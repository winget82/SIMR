            <p>
                This Website is called SIMR, which is an abbreviation
                for "Scripture Indices & Ministry Resources."
                It is a compilation of the works of many, many
                others.  Others who have spent countless hours studying &
                teaching the Word of God.  My thanks to them for making
                researching God's Word so much easier for us!<br>
                <br>
                The goal of this website, is to provide a tool to easily
                compile resources for researching God's Word.  A tool to
                help redeem the time as we diligently study God's Word.
                To 'simmer' is to be at a temperature just below the
                boiling point.  It's to be in a state of the initial
                stages of development...<br>
                <br>
                I thought this fitting, as when we're researching a topic,
                the research we are doing is developing into something more.
                Such as a teaching or a research work.  Not only that, but
                if you desire to boil over with God's Word, to heat to that
                point, you've got to let the Word burn within you.  You
                need to steep in it.  My believing is that this tool will
                help you in your endeavours as you stand for God in this
                day, time, and hour.<br>
                <br>
                Love in Christ,<br>
