It has been dealt with, for the most part, in a fragmentary way. One has \ndealt with some particular number, such as \"seven\"; another has been content with a view of the \nprimary numbers, and even when defining their significance, has given only one or two \nexamples by way of illustration; another has confined himself to \"symbolical numbers,\" such as \n10, 40, 666, etc.; another has taken up such symbolical numbers in their relation to chronology \nor to prophecy; another has collected examples, but has dealt little with their meaning. There seemed, therefore, to be room, and indeed a call, for a work which would be more complete, embrace a larger area, and at the same time be free from the many fancies which all, \nmore or less, indulge in when the mind is occupied too much with one subject. Anyone who \nvalues the importance of a particular principle will be tempted to see it where it does not exist, \nand if it be not there will force it in, in spite sometimes of the original text. Especially is this the \ncase when chronology is dealt with, the greater uncertainty of dates lending itself more readily \nto the author's fancy. The greatest work on this subject, both chronological and numerical, is not free from these defects. But its value is nevertheless very great. It is by the late Dr. Milo Mahan, of New York. \nHis work Palmoni*, which was republished among his collected works, has long been out of \nprint. It greatly increased my interest in this subject, and led me to further study, besides \nfurnishing a number of valuable illustrations. * Not the anonymous Palmoni by an English author, published in London. It is too much to hope that the present work should be free from these defects, which are \ninseparable from human infirmity. From one point of view it is a subject which must prove \ndisappointing, at any rate to the author, for illustrations are continually being discovered; and \nyet, from another point of view, it would be blasphemy to suppose that such a work could be \ncomplete; for it would assume that the wonders of this mine could be exhausted, and that its \ntreasures could be all explored! I must, therefore, be content with the setting forth of general principles, and with giving a few examples from God's Word which illustrate them, leaving others to extend the application of \nthese principles and search out illustrations of them for themselves. May the result of this contribution to a great subject be to stimulate the labours of Bible students; to strengthen believers in their most holy faith; and to convince doubters of the Divine \nperfection and inspiration of the Book of Books, to the praise and glory of God. E.W. BULLINGER \n17 North End Road,            Golders Green, N.W.  Back | Contents | Next PART I ITS SUPERNATURAL DESIGN Chapter I DESIGN SHOWN IN THE WORKS OF GOD  \"Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of His hand; \nAnd meted out heaven with a span; And comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, \nAnd weighed the mountains in scales, \nAnd the hills in a balance?\" (Isa \n40:12) \"The works of the LORD are great, Sought out of all them that have \npleasure therein.\" (Psa 111:2) There can be neither works nor words without number. We can understand how man can act and speak \nwithout design or significance, but we cannot imagine that the great and infinite Creator and Redeemer \ncould either work or speak without both His words and His works being absolutely perfect in every \nparticular. \"As for God His WAY is perfect\" (Psa 18:30). \"The Law of the LORD is perfect\" (Psa 19:7). They are both perfect in power, perfect in holiness and righteousness, perfect in design, perfect in execution, \nperfect in their object and end, and, may we not say, perfect in number. \"The LORD is righteous in all His ways: and holy in all His works\" (Psa 145:17). \nAll His works were (and are) done, and all His words were spoken and written, in the right way, at the right time, in the right order, and in the right number. \"He telleth the number of the stars\" (Psa 147:4). \nHe \"bringeth out their host by number\" (Isa 40:26). \"He weigheth the waters by measure\" (Job 28:25). We may, therefore, say with David: \"I meditate on all Thy works; I muse on the work of Thy hands\" (Psa 143:5). In all the works of God we find not only what we call \"Law,\" and a Law-maker, but we observe a Law enforcer. We speak of laws, but they are nothing in themselves. They have no being; they possess no \npower; they cannot make themselves, or carry themselves out. What we mean when we speak of law in \nnature is simply this: God in action; God not merely giving or making laws, but carrying them out and \nenforcing them. As He is perfect, so His works and His words also must be perfect. And when we see number used not by chance, but by design; not at haphazard, but with significance; then we see not merely so many works \nand words, but the Living God working and speaking. In this first part of our subject we are to speak only of design in the use of number; and in the second part, of significance. In this first chapter we will confine our thoughts to design as it is seen in the works \nof God; and in the second, as it is seen in the Word of God. When we see the same design in each; the same laws at work; the same mysterious principles being carried out in each, the conviction is overwhelming that we have the same great Designer, the same \nAuthor; and we see the same Hand, the same seal stamped on all His works, and the same signature or \nautograph, as it were, upon every page of His Word. And that, not an autograph which may be torn off or \nobliterated, but indelible, like the water-mark in the paper; so impressed upon and interwoven with it \nthat no power on earth can blot it out. Let us turn first to THE HEAVENSHere we see number displayed in a remarkable manner. The 12 signs of the Zodiac, each with three constellations, making 36 in all, which together with the 12 signs make a total of 48. There must be a \nreason, therefore, why the number 12 should thus pervade the heavens. Why should 12 be the \npredominating factor? Why should it not be 11, or 13, or 7, or 20? Because 12 is one of the four perfect numbers, the number of governmental perfection; hence it is associated with the rule of the heavens, for the sun is given \"to rule the day,\" and the moon \"to govern \nthe night.\" The significance of this, however, must be deferred till we come to consider the number \n\"twelve\" under this head. It is enough for us now to notice the fact here, upon the threshold of our \nsubject, that we have one common measure, or factor, which is seen in the 12 signs of the Zodiac, the 36 \n(3x12) constellations,* the total 48 (4x12); the 360 (12x30) degrees, into which the great circle of the \nheavens is divided. No one can tell us why the number of degrees was first fixed at 360. It has come down \nto us from ancient times, and is used universally without a question.** And it is this division of the \nZodiac which gives us the 12 months of the Zodiacal year. This is called also the Prophetic year, for it is \nthe year which is used in the prophecies of the Bible.*** * There are other modern constellations now: Hevelius (1611-1687) added twenty-two; Halley \n(1656-1742) added fifteen. But every one knows how different these are from the ancient \nconstellations, both in their names, their character, and their utter absence of all significance.** It probably arises from the product of the four numbers, 3, 4, 5, 6, which arise out of the phenomena which lie at the root of Geometrical and Arithmetical Science. 3 x 4 x 5 x 6 = 360, while 360 x 7 = 2520. *** There are different or relative kinds of years, according as we reckon the revolutions of the sun in relation to certain objects, e.g.: (1.) In relation to the equinoctial points. The time taken \nby the sun to return to the same equinoctial point is called the Solar year (also the Civil, or \nTropical year), and consists of 365.2422414 solar days (or 365 days 5 hours 48 minutes 49.7 \nseconds). (2.) In relation to the stars. The time taken by the sun to return to the same fixed star \nis called the Sidereal year, and consists of 365.2563612 solar days (or 365 days 6 hours 9 \nminutes 9.6 seconds). (3.) In relation to his own orbit. The time taken by the sun to return to the \nsame point in his own orbit is called the Anomalistic year, and consists of 365.2595981 solar \ndays (or 365 days 6 hours 13 minutes 49.3 seconds). The word \"Anomalistic\" means irregular, and this kind of year is so called because from it the first irregularities of planetary motion were discovered. Here, then, is an example of number as it is used in the heavens. Twelve is the pervading factor. CHRONOLOGYIt is not necessary to go into the intricacies of this vast part of our subject. Notwithstanding the fact that \nGod gave to man these heavenly time-keepers, he has so misused the gift (as he has every other gift \nwhich God has ever given him) that he cannot tell you now what year it really is! No subject is in more \nhopeless confusion, made worse by those who desire the dates to fit in with their theories of numbers, \ninstead of with the facts of history. We shall, therefore, avoid man's use of numbers. Our only concern in this work is with God's use of them. Here we shall find both design and significance. Here, therefore, we shall find that which is certain and full of interest. The first natural division of time is stamped by the Number seven. On the seventh day God rested from His work of Creation. When He ordained the ritual for Israel which should show forth His work of Redemption, seven is again stamped upon it in all its times and seasons. The seventh day was the holy day; the seventh month was \nspecially hallowed by its number of sacred festivals; the seventh year was the Sabbatic year of rest for \nthe land: while 7 x 7 years marked the year of Jubilee (Lev 25:4,8). Thirty jubilees bring us from the Exodus to the opening of Christ's ministry, when, opening Isaiah 61:2, He proclaimed \"the acceptable year of the Lord\" in a seven-fold prophecy (see Luke 4:18-21). The great symbolical divisions of Israel's history, or rather of the times of God's dealings with them, are marked by the same number; and if we confine ourselves to duration of years rather than to the succession of years and chronological dates; with kairoV (kairos), season, a definitely limited portion of \ntime, rather than with cronoV (chronos), time, the course of time in general* (hence our word \"chronology\"), \u0160we shall have no difficulty. * In modern Greek kairoV has come to mean weather, and cronoV, year, thus preserving the essential distinction between the two words. God's dealings with His people have to do with actual duration of time rather than with specific dates; and we find that His dealings with Israel were measured out into four periods, each consisting of 490 (70 \ntimes 7) years. Thus:\u0160 The 1st. From Abraham to the Exodus. \nThe 2nd. The Exodus to the Dedication of Temple. \nThe 3rd. From the Temple to Nehemiah's return. \nThe 4th. From Nehemiah to the Second Advent.It is clear that these are periods of duration having regard only to Israel, and to Jehovah's immediate \ndealings with them. For in each one there is a period of time during which He was not immediately \ngoverning them, but in which His hand was removed, and His people were without visible tokens of His \npresence with them. 1. From the birth of Abraham to the Exodus Years TotalFrom the birth of Abraham to the Exodus was actually (Gen 12:4, 16:3 and 21:5)* 505  But deducting the 15 years while Ishmael was Abram's seed, \ndelaying the seed of promise - 15  Leaving the first 70 x 7 of years   490 *Abraham was 75 years old when the promise (Gen 12:4) was made to him. The Law was given \n430 years after (Exo 12:40; Gal 3:17). But 430 and 75 make 505 years, or 15 years over the \n490. How are we to account for this gap of 15 years as forming part of the 505 years? The \nanswer is that at Abraham's departure into Canaan (12:4) he was 75 years old, Ishmael was \nborn 10 years after (16:3), therefore Abraham was 85 years old at Ishmael's birth. But he was \n100 years old when Isaac was born (21:5). Therefore it follows that there were 15 years (100 \nminus 85=15) during which Ishmael was occupying and usurping the place of the \"promised \nseed\"; and 15 from 505 leaves 490. Here then we have the first of the seventy-seven of years, and the first \"gap\" of 15 years. 2. From the Exodus to the foundation of the Temple, according to Acts 13:20:* Years TotalIn the Wilderness 40  Under the Judges 450  Saul 40  David 40  Solomon (1 Kings 6:1,37) 3  But from these we must deduct the Captivities under   573Cushan (Judges 3:8) 8   Eglon (Judges 3:14) 18   Jabin (Judges 4:3) 20   Midianites (Judges 6:1) 7   Philistines (Judges 13:1)** 40 93 Leaving   480 To this we must add the years during which the Temple was in building, for the finishing of the house (1 Kings 6:38) 7   And at least for the furnishing and ending of all the work (1 Kings \n7:13-51)*** 3   Making altogether the second 70 x 7 of years   490 * The actual number of years was 573, according to Acts 13:20. But 1 Kings 6:1 says: \"It came \nto pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of \nEgypt...he began to build the house of the LORD.\" Therefore commentators immediately \nconclude that the book is wrong. It never seems to dawn on them that they can be wrong. But \nthey are, because the number is ordinal, not cardinal, and it does not say four hundred and \neighty years, but \"eightieth year.\" The 480th from or of what? Of the duration of God's dealings \nwith His people, deducting the 93 years while He had \"sold them\" into the hands of others. Thus \nthere is no discrepancy between 1 Kings 6:1 and Acts 13:20. In the Acts the actual number of years is stated in a cardinal number; while in the Kings a certain reckoning is made in an ordinal number, and a certain year in the order of God's dealings with His people is named. \nAnd yet by some, the inspiration of Acts 13:20 is impugned, and various shifts are resorted to, \nto make it what man thinks to be correct. The RV adopts an ancient punctuation which does not \nafter all remove the difficulty; while in the Speaker's Commentary the words in 1 Kings 6:1 are \nprinted within brackets, as though they were of doubtful authority.** The 18 years of Judges 10:8 were part of the joint 40 years' oppression; on the one side Jordan by the Philistines, and on \"the other side Jordan in the land of the Amorites\" by the \nAmmonites. *** For in 1 Kings 8:2 it was dedicated in the seventh month, though it was finished in the eighth month. Therefore it could not have been the same year; and it may well have required \nthree years for the completion of all the interior work described in 1 Kings 7:13-51. 3. From the Dedication of the Temple to Nehemiah's return in the 20th year of Artaxerxes Years TotalFrom the dedication to Nehemiah's return (Neh 2:1) 560  Deduct the 70 years' Captivity in Babylon (Jer 25:11,12; Dan 9:2) 70  Leaving the third 70 x 7 years   4904. From Nehemiah's return to \"cutting off\" of \"Messiah the Prince\" (Dan 9:24-27) Years TotalThe \"Seven weeks\" (7x7) 49  The \"Threescore and two weeks\" (62x7) 434  \"After\" this, Messiah was to be \"cut off,\" and then comes this \npresent interval, the longest of all, now more than 1890 years, to \nbe followed, when God again deals with His people Israel, by \n\"One week\"* 7      490 * This \"one week\" must be future, because since Messiah was \"cut off\" no prince has come and \nmade a covenant with the Jews and in the \"midst of the week\" caused \"the sacrifice and the \noblation to cease.\" This is specially stated to be the work of \"the Prince that shall come.\" See \nDaniel 8:11, where it is done by \"the little horn\"; 11:31, where it is the work of \"the vile \nperson\" (different names for the same person); and 12:11. All these four passages are the work \nof the same person, and that person is not Christ, but Antichrist. Besides, Messiah was \"cut off\" \nafter the \"threescore and two weeks,\" i.e., at the end of the second of these three divisions. This cannot be the same event as that which is to take place \"in the midst\" of the third of these three divisions. In a prophecy so distinct, that the very distinction is the essential part of it, it is \nimpossible for us to introduce such confusion by violently taking an event declared to take place \n\"after\" the end of the second period and say it is the same event which is spoken of as taking \nplace in the middle of the third; and at the same time, out of four distinct descriptions of the \nlatter event to make one refer to the former and three to the latter\u0160this is simply trifling with \nthe Word of God. A system of interpretation which requires such violent and unwarranted treatment of God's Word stands self-condemned. Thus the number seven is stamped on \"the times and seasons\" of Scripture, marking the spiritual perfection of the Divine Prophecies.   NATUREWe see the same law at work in various departments of nature. Sometimes one number is the dominant factor, sometimes another. In nature seven is found to mark the only possible mode of classification of the mass of individuals which constitutes the special department called science. We give the seven \ndivisions, with examples from the animal and vegetable kingdoms. The one specimen of an animal (the \ndog) and one specimen of a flower (the rose). I. KINGDOM Animal VegetableII. SUB-KINGDOM Vertebrata PhanerogamiaIII. CLASS Mammalia DicotyledonIV. ORDER Carnivora RosifloraeV. FAMILY Canidae RosaciaeVI. GENUS Dog RosaVII. SPECIES Spaniel Tea-rose  THE VEGETABLE KINGDOMHere all is law and order. Number comes in, in many cases determining various classifications. In the \nEndogens (or inside-growing plants) three is a prevailing number; while in Exogens (or outside-growing \nplants) five is a prevailing number. The grains in Indian corn, or maize, are set in rows, generally straight, but in some cases spirally. These rows are always arranged in an even number. Never odd! They range from 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and \nsometimes as high as 24. But never in 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, or any odd number of rows. The even number is \npermanent. Mr. H. L. Hastings tells of one farmer who looked for 27 years and could not find a \"cob\" \nwith an odd number of rows. A slave was once offered his freedom if he found a corn-cob with an odd \nnumber, and one day he found one! But he had found it also some time before, when it was young; \ncarefully cut out one row, and bound it up, so that the parts grew together as the corn-cob developed, \nand finally presented the phenomenon of having an odd number of rows. This exception proves the rule \nin an interesting manner. If we notice how the leaves grow upon the stem of a plant, not only is law seen in classifying their nature and character, but number is observed in their arrangement and disposition. Some are placed \nalternately, some opposite, while others are arranged spirally. But in each case all is in perfect order. \nAfter a certain number of leaves one will come immediately over and in the same line with the first:\u0160 l     In the apple it is the fifth leaf, l     In the oak it is the fourth, l     In the peach, etc., it is the sixth, l     In the holly, etc., it is the eighth; but it takes two turns of the spiral before the eighth leaf stands \nimmediately over the first. l     In the larch it is the twenty-first leaf; but it is not until after eight turns of the spiral that the \ntwenty-first leaf stands directly over the first. Examples might be multiplied indefinitely were design in nature our only subject. We are anxious to search the Word of God, and therefore can touch merely the surface of His works, but sufficiently to \nillustrate the working of Law and the presence of the Law-enforcer.   PHYSIOLOGYoffers a vast field for illustration, but here again the grand impress is seen to be the number seven. The days of man's years are \"Three-score years and ten\" (7x10). In seven years the whole structure of his \nbody changes: and we are all familiar with \"the seven ages of man.\" There are seven Greek words used to describe these seven ages, according to Philo:\u0160 1.  Infancy (paidion, paidion, child). 2.  Childhood (paiV, pais boy). \n3.  Youth (meirakion, meirakion, lad, stripling). \n4.  Adolescence (neaniskoV, neaniskos, young man). 5.  Manhood (anhr, aner, man). 6.  Decline (presbuthV, presbutes, old man). \n7.  Senility (gerwn, geron, aged man).  The various periods of gestation also are commonly a multiple of seven, either of days or weeks.With INSECTS the ova are hatched from seven half-days (as the wasp, bee, etc.); while with others it is seven whole days. The majority of insects require from 14 (2x7) to 42 (6x7) days; the same applies to the \nlarva state. With ANIMALS the period of gestation of\u0160 The mouse is 21 (3x7) days. The hare and rat, 28 (4x7) days. \nThe cat, 56 (8x7) days. \nThe dog, 63 (9x7) days. \nThe lion, 98 (14x7) days. \nThe sheep, 147 (21x7) days.With BIRDS, the gestation of\u0160 The common hen is 21 (3x7) days. \nThe duck, 42 (6x7) days.With the Human species it is 280 days (or 40x7). Moreover, man appears to be made on what we may call the seven-day principle. In various diseases the seventh, fourteenth, and twenty-first are critical days; and in others seven or 14 half-days. Man's pulse beats on the seven-day principle, for Dr. Stratton points out that for six days out of the seven it beats \nfaster in the morning than in the evening, while on the seventh day it beats slower. Thus the number \nseven is stamped upon physiology, and he is thus admonished, as man, to rest one day in seven. He cannot violate this law with impunity, for it is interwoven with his very being. He may say \"I will rest when I please,\"\u0160 one day in ten, or irregularly, or not at all. He might as well say of his eight-day clock, \n\"It is mine, and I will wind it up when I please.\" Unless he wound it at least once in eight days, according \nto the principle on which it was made, it would be worthless as a clock. So with man's body. If he rests \nnot according to the Divine law, he will, sooner or later, be compelled to \"keep his sabbaths,\" and the \nrest which he would not take at regular intervals, at God's command, he has to take at the command of \nman all at once! Even in this case God gives him more rest than he can get for himself; for God would \nhave him take 52 days' rest in the year, and the few days' \"change\" he is able to get for himself is a poor \nsubstitute for this. It is like all man's attempts to improve on God's way. It is not always seven, however, which is the predominant factor in physiology or natural history. \nIn the case of the BEE, it is the number three which pervades its phenomena\u0160 l     In three days the egg of the queen is hatched. l     It is fed for nine days (3x3). l     It reaches maturity in 15 days (5x3). l     The worker grub reaches maturity in 21 days (7x3). l     And is at work three days after leaving its cell. l     The drone matures in 24 days (8x3). l     The bee is composed of three sections,\u0160 head and two stomachs. l     The two eyes are made up of about 3,000 small eyes, each (like the cells of the comb) having six sides (2x3). l     Underneath the body are six (2x3) wax scales with which the comb is made. l     It has six (2x3) legs. Each leg is composed of three sections. l     The foot is formed of three triangular sections. l     The antennae consist of nine (3x3) sections. l     The sting has nine (3x3) barbs on each side. Is this design? or is it chance? Why should it be the number three instead of any other number? No one \ncan tell. We can only observe the wondrous working of supernatural laws, and admire the perfection of \ndesign.   CHEMISTRYHere we are met with a field of research in which constant discoveries are being made. Chemistry is worthy of the name Science. Here are no theories and hypotheses, which deprive other so-called sciences \nof all title to the name. Science is Scientia, knowledge, that which we know, and what we know is truth \nwhich can never alter. Chemistry, for example, is not like geology, whose old theories are constantly \nbeing superseded by new ones. If we know the action of a certain substance, then our knowledge never \nchanges. But side by side with this unchangeable truth there is the constant discovery of new truths. All matter is made up of certain combinations of various elements, which are its ultimate, indecomposable constituents. Not that these elements are absolutely simple, but that hitherto they have \nnot been decomposed. Some of these have been known from the most ancient times, while others are of \nquite recent discovery. Hence their number is slowly being increased. In 1874 there were 64; now there \nare about 70. But though their total number cannot yet be known, the law by which they are arranged has been discovered. This law is complex, but perfect. 1. All the elements when magnetized fall into two classes. One class immediately ranges itself east and west, at right angles to the line of magnetic force (which is north and south), and is hence called \nDiamagnetic (i.e. through or across the magnet); while the other immediately ranges itself by the side of \nand parallel to the magnetic pole (i.e. north and south), and is called Paramagnetic (i.e. by the side of \nthe magnet). 2. Further, it is observed that these elements have other properties. Some combine with only one atom of another element, and are called Monads; some combine with only two atoms of another element, and are \ncalled Diads; some combine with only three, and are called Triads: while those that combine with four \nare called Tetrads, etc. 3. Now when the elements are arranged, first on the two sides of the dividing line, according to their Diamagnetic and Paramagnetic characters; and then placed on lines according to their properties as Monads, Diads, etc.; and further, are arranged in the order of their atomic weights,* the result is seen in \nthe accompanying illustration [Reynold's Curve of the Elements according to the Newlands-Mendelejeff \nPeriodic Law], which exhibits the presence and working of a wonderful law. * The atomic weight is the smallest weight according to which different elements combine; e.g. \nhydrogen, whose atomic weight is 2, will combine with oxygen, whose atomic weight is 16, \nforming water. With carbon, whose atomic weight is 12, it combines also the same proportion of \n2 to 12 (or 1 to 6). These are what are called the atomic weights, or the \"combining proportions.\" On carefully examining this table it will be seen,\u0160 1. That on either side of the central or neutral line, there are alternate groups of seven elements, and that these seven fall into the form of an introversion, Monad answering to Monad, Diad to Diad, etc., thus:\u0160 Monad >>>>> Diad \n>>>>> Triad \n>>>>>        TetradMonad >>>>> Diad \n>>>>> Triad \n>>>>>  Then, on the other side, the group of seven is arranged in the opposite way, but in a corresponding \nmanner:\u0160   <<<<< \nTriad <<<<< \nDiad <<<<< MonadTetrad        <<<<< \nTriad <<<<< \nDiad <<<<< MonadThus we have an introversion of seven elements alternated throughout the entire series. 2. Next observe that each time the line crosses upward from right to left there is a group of three neutral elements that occur together, near the atomic weights of 60, 100, and 190. So perfect is the law that the discoverers believe that about the points 20 and 155 there are yet two sets of three elements to be discovered... 3. Also observe that when the lines pass upward from left to right there are no elements whatever on this neutral line, and therefore we do not expect any to be discovered. 4. Further, that there are others which will yet be discovered to fill in the gaps that are left vacant, above the weights 145. A few years ago the number stood at 64. The present list contains 69. Some newly-\ndiscovered elements have been brought under notice while writing these words. They are Cerium, 141.5; \nNeodymium, 140.8; Praseodunium, 143.6; and \"Ytterbium,\" 173. These with others that may yet be \ndiscovered will fill up some of the gaps that remain. 5. There is an element whose atomic weight is a multiple of 7 (or very nearly so) for every multiple up to 147, while the majority of the others are either square numbers (or multiples of a square number), multiples of 11, or cube numbers. Indeed we may say that every important element is a multiple of either 4 or 7; gold, the most valuable, for example, being 196 (4x72); iron, the most useful, 56 (7x23); silver being 108 (4x27, or 22x33), copper 63 (7x9), carbon 12 (3x4), mercury 200 (4x50), bismuth 208 (4x52), etc.* * Where the others are not exact multiples of these numbers, they are so nearly exact that the slight uncertainty in the accepted weights might account for some of the differences. 6. Note that all the parts of the image which Nebuchadnezzar saw in his dream are here, and they are all on the left or diamagnetic side; that is to say, they are at cross purposes with the line of Divine \ngovernment! The three which are pure and unmixed are all on the same line of monads\u0160\"gold,\" \"silver,\" \nand \"copper,\"\u0160while the fourth, \"iron,\" is neutral, neither for nor against, like the fourth power, which \nis both religious and at the same time antichristian. The heaviest is at the top and the lightest at the \nbottom, as though to show us that the image being top-heavy is not destined to stand. Three have already \npassed away; the fourth is approaching its end; and presently, the \"power\" which was committed to the \nGentiles shall be given to Him \"whose right it is,\" and the fifth monarchy (illustrated by the Rock out of \nwhich all the others proceed) shall swallow all up when the kingdoms of this world shall become the \nkingdom of our Lord and of His Christ. Thus the very elements of matter are all arranged according to number and law. When this law was first spoken of, it appeared to some chemists to be as absurd as suggesting that the alphabetical arrangement \ncould be the scientific or natural order. But here we have a natural, or rather, we should say, a Divine order. For the elements, when arranged according to the weights and properties which God has given to them, are found to fall into this \nwondrous order. Here there can be no room for human fancy, but all is the result of knowledge, or \nscience truly so called.   SOUND AND MUSICSound is the impression produced on the ear by the vibrations of air. The pitch of the musical note is higher or lower according as these vibrations are faster or slower. When they are too slow, or not \nsufficiently regular and continuous to make a musical sound, we call it noise. Experiments have long been completed which fix the number of vibrations for each musical note; by which, of course, we may easily calculate the difference between the number of vibrations between each note. These were finally settled at Stuttgart in 1834. They were adopted by the Paris Conservatoire in 1859, but it was not till 1869 that they were adopted in England by the Society of Arts. The following is the \nscale of Do showing the number of vibrations in a second under each note and the differences between \nthem:\u0160 C Do   D Re   E Mi   F Fa   G Sol   A La   B Si   C Do264 (24x11) (33) 297 (27x11) (33) 330 (30x11) (22) 352 (32x11) (44) 396 (36x11) (44) 440 (40x11) (55) 495 (45x11) (33) 528 (48x11)In the upper row of figures, those immediately under each note are the number of vibrations producing \nsuch note. The figures in brackets, between these numbers, show the difference between these vibrations. \nThe figures in the lower line are merely the factors of the respective numbers. On examining the above it will be at once seen that the number eleven is stamped upon music; and we may say seven also, for there are seven notes of the scale (the eighth being the repetition of the first). The number of vibrations in a second, for each note, is a multiple of eleven, and the difference in the number of vibrations between each note is also a multiple of eleven. These differences are not always the \nsame. We speak of tones and semitones, as though all tones were alike, and all semitones were alike; but \nthis is not the case. The difference between the semitone Mi and Fa* is 22; while between the other \nsemitone, Si and Do, it is 33. So with the tones: the difference between the tone Do and Re, for example, \nis 33; while between Fa and Sol it is 44; between Sol and La it is 44; and between La and Si it is 55. * In using this notation it is worth recording and remembering, in passing (though it is hardly \nrelevant to our subject), the origin of what is now called Solfeggio. It arose from a Mediaeval \nhymn to John the Baptist which had this peculiarity that the first six lines of the music \ncommenced respectively on the first six successive notes of the scale, and thus the first syllable \nof each line was sung to a note one degree higher than the first syllable of the line that preceded \nit:\u0160Ut queant laxis \nRe-sonare fibris \nMi-ra gestorum \nFa-muli tuorum \nSol-ve polluti \nLa-bii reatum \nSancto Iohannes By degrees these syllables became associated and identified with their respective notes, and as \neach syllable ended with a vowel they were found to be peculiarly adapted for vocal use. Hence \nUt was artificially replaced by \"Do.\" Guido of Arezzo was the first to adopt them in the 11th century, and Le Maire, a French musician of the 17th century, added \"Si\" for the seventh note of the scale, in order to complete the series. It might have been formed from the initial letters of the two words in this line, S and I. The ear can detect and convey these vibrations to the brain only within certain limits. Each ear has within it a minute organ, like a little harp, with about ten thousand strings. These organs were \ndiscovered by an Italian named Corti, and hence have been named \"the organs of Corti.\" When a sound is made, the corresponding string of this little harp vibrates in sympathy, and conveys the impression to the brain. The immense number of these little strings provides for the conveyance of every conceivable \nsound within certain limits. In the scale, as we have seen, there is a range of 264 vibrations. There is a \ndifference between each one, so that there are practically 264 notes in the scale, but the ear cannot \ndetect them. The ear of a skilled violinist can detect many more than an ordinary untrained ear. The \nmechanical action of a pianoforte can record only twelve of these notes. The violin can be made to \nproduce a much larger number, and is therefore more perfect as an instrument, but not equal in this \nrespect to the human voice. The wonderful mechanism of the human voice, being created by God, far \nexcels every instrument that man can make. There are vibrations which the ear cannot detect, so slow as to make no audible sound, but there are contrivances by which they can be made visible to the eye. When sand is thrown upon a thin metal disc, \nto which a chord is attached and caused to vibrate, the sand will immediately arrange itself in a perfect \ngeometrical pattern. The pattern will vary with the number of the vibrations. These are called \"Chladni's \nfigures.\" Moist plaster on glass or moist water-colour on rigid surfaces will vibrate at the sound, say, of \nthe human voice, or of a cornet, and will assume forms of various kinds\u0160geometrical, vegetable and \nfloral; some resembling ferns, others resembling leaves and shells, according to the pitch of the note. The \"Pendulograph\" is another contrivance for rendering these vibrations visible to the eye; and for exhibiting depths of sound which are totally inaudible to the ear. The pen is attached to one pendulum \nand the paper to the other, and these are made to oscillate at right angles with each other. When each \npendulum is set at the same length (making the same number of vibrations in the same time), the figure \nmade by the pen will be a perfect circle. But when these lengths (or vibrations) vary, the patterns that are \ndescribed are as exquisite as they are marvelous, and almost infinite in their variety and design. Even the organs of Corti are limited in their perception, notwithstanding the many thousands of minute vibrating chords. When these organs are perfect or well formed there is what is called \"an ear for \nmusic.\" But in many cases there is \"no ear for music.\" This means that these organs are defective, not \nfully developed, or malformed, in the case of such persons; and that the sounds are not accurately \nconveyed to the brain. There is a solemn and important truth therefore in the words, \"He that planted the ear\"! (Psa 94:9). What wondrous planting! Not every one has this peculiar (musical) \"ear.\" And no one has by nature that ear which can distinguish the things of God. The spiritual ear is the direct gift and planting of God. Hence it is written, \"He that \nhath an ear,\" i.e., only he that hath that divinely-planted, God-given ear can hear the things of the Spirit \nof God. \"An ear to hear\" those spiritual things is a far greater reality, and an infinitely greater gift, than \nan ear for music! Oh wondrous ear! It is the Lord that gives \"the hearing ear\" (Prov 20:12). He \nwakeneth the ear to hear (Isa 50:4); It is the Lord that openeth the ear (Isa 50:5). The natural ear does \nnot hear spiritual sounds; it cannot discern them (Isa 64:4 and 1 Cor 2:9). Thus nature and grace \nillustrate each other, and reveal the great fact that there is a secret ear, more delicate than any \"organs \nof Corti,\" that can detect sounds invisible as well as inaudible to the senses, and which enables those \nwho possess it to say:\u0160 \"Sweeter sounds than music knows \nCharm me in Emanuel's name; All her hopes my spirit owes To His birth, and cross, and shame.\"  COLOUROne more step brings us to colour, which is caused by the vibrations of light, as sound is caused by the vibrations of air. There is a relation between the two, so that a particular colour corresponds to a \nparticular note in music. Hence there are seven colours answering to the seven musical sounds, and it is found that sounds which harmonize, correspond with colours that harmonize. While discords in colour correspond with discords \nin music. The seven, both in music and colour, are divided into three and four. Three primary colours and four secondary, from which all others proceed, answer to the three primary sounds called the Tri-chord, or \ncommon chord, and four secondary. The subject is too abstruse to enlarge further upon here. Sufficient has been said to show that in the works of God all is perfect harmony, order and symmetry, both in number and design; and one \ncorresponds with the other in a real and wonderful manner. The one great question now is, May we not expect to find the same phenomena in that greatest of all God's works, viz., His Word? If not the greatest in some senses, yet it is the greatest in its importance to \nus. For if we find in it the same corresponding perfection in design, then we see throughout the whole of \nit the same mysterious autograph. And its truths, and promises, and precepts come to us with increased \nsolemnity and power; for the words of the book say with the stars of heaven \"The hand that made us is divine.\"Back | Contents | Next Table of ContentsPrefacePART I SUPERNATURAL DESIGN CHAPTER 1 THE WORKS OF GODThe Heavens Chronology Nature The Vegetable Kingdom Physiology Chemistry Sound and Music  Colour CHAPTER II THE WORD OF GODThe Books of the Bible The Writers Occurrences of Words in Old Testament Occurrences of Words in New Testament Occurrences of Words in the Apocalypse Occurrences of Phrases Evidence as to Authorship of Hebrews and 2 Peter Occurrences of Words and Phrases in Old and New Testaments combined PART II SPIRITUAL SIGNIFICANCEIntroduction One Two Three Four Five Six Seven Six and Seven together Seven by itself Eight Eight and Seven together Eight by itself Eight and Thirteen together Nine Ten Eleven Twelve Thirteen Fourteen Fifteen Seventeen Nineteen Twenty Twenty-one Twenty-two Twenty-four Twenty-five Twenty-seven Twenty-eight Twenty-nine Thirty Thirty-one Forty Forty-two Fifty Fifty-one Sixty-five Seventy One hundred and twenty One hundred and fifty and three Two hundred Three hundred and ninety Four hundred Four hundred and thirty Four hundred and ninety Six hundred and sixty-six Conclusion     Back | Contents | Next PART I ITS SUPERNATURAL DESIGN Chapter II DESIGN SHOWN IN THE WORD OF GODWe now come to the Word of God, which is the greatest, and, to us, most important of all God's works. May we not look for, and expect to find, number used not only with the same wondrous \ndesign, but, here, with significance also? If there be design, there must be significance. We may \nnot always see the reason for the latter in the works of creation; but we cannot fail to do so in \nthe great work of Divine Revelation. In Daniel 8:13 we read, \"Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that certain saint which spake, How long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, and the \ntransgression of desolation,\" etc.? Here, a revelation of a certain future prophetic event was \nmade to Daniel, by a certain saint or holy one, i.e., a holy angel; and \"another\" angel asked a \nquestion concerning numbers\u0160\"How long,\" etc.? The name of \"that certain saint\" is given in \nthe Hebrew, and is placed in the margin, with its meaning. His name is \"PALMONI,\" and it \nmeans \"the numberer of secrets, or the wonderful numberer.\" So that there is one holy angel, at least, whose function has to do with numbers. Numbers, therefore, and their secrets, hold an important place in the words as well as in the works of God. \n\"A wonderful numberer\" (\"PALMONI\") presides over them, and has his place in making known \nthe things of God. This certainly looks like design; and, if so\u0160if not only the \"days\" in which revealed events shall take place are numbered, but the words also themselves are numbered\u0160 then we shall have a \ngreat and wondrous proof of the Divine, verbal, and even literal inspiration of the Word of God. \"It is the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honour of kings is to search out a matter\" (Prov 25:2). In searching out, therefore, the secrets of the Word of God, we are doing \nnot only a royal, but an honourable work. \"The work s of the LORD are great: sought out of all them that have pleasure therein\" (Psa 111:2). This is quite different, of course, from trying to find out what God calls His \"secret \nthings.\" \"The secret things belong unto the LORD our God; but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever\" (Deut 29:29). Our searching must be confined to what is \nrevealed. With what God has been pleased not to reveal, but to keep secret, not only have we \nnothing whatever to do, but we are guilty of the sin of presumption in even speculating about it. If a child of God is observed to be much occupied with God's \"secret things,\" he will be found to be one who neglects the study of the things which God has revealed. We can have neither words nor works without \"number.\" The question which we have to answer is\u0160Is number used with design or by chance? Surely if God uses it, it must be with infinite \nwisdom and with glorious perfection. And so it is. Each number has its own significance; and its \nmeaning is found to be in moral harmony and relation to the subject matter in connection with \nwhich it stands. This harmony is always perfect. Every word of God's Book is in its right place. \nIt may sometimes seem to us to be deranged. The lock may be in one place, and the key may \nsometimes be hidden away elsewhere in some apparently inadvertent word or sentence. A volume might be written in illustration of this fact; and it would be a profitable Bible-study to search out these little seemingly unimportant keys. For example: In Genesis 11 and 12, we see how Abram came out of Ur of the Chaldees, but instead of going on at once to Canaan, he stops a long time in Haran. The explanation of this \ndelay is not given there. It is hidden away in Acts 7:4, where we read, \"from thence [i.e. from \nHaran] when his father was dead.\" From which we learn that Terah was the hindrance; and we \nare taught by the fact, thus emphasized, how earthly relationships may sometimes hinder our \ncomplete obedience. Another example is Isaiah 52:4: \"My people went down aforetime into Egypt to sojourn there; and the Assyrian oppressed them without case.\" Here is a very difficult lock. This verse has \ngreatly puzzled commentators, who assume that two oppressions are spoken of, one in Egypt \nand the other in Assyria. They are therefore at a loss to understand and explain why these two \noppressions are mentioned together in one verse, as though they were closely connected, when \nin fact they were separated by more than seven centuries. The key is hidden away in one little \nword in Acts 7:18, \"There arose another king.\" The word here translated \"another\" is not alloV, another of the same kind; but it is eteroV, another of a different kind; showing us that it was a different dynasty altogether: and the monuments now prove that it was a new Assyrian \ndynasty.* * The last king of the 18th dynasty, Amenhotep IV, was succeeded by a new race of \nkings which is called the 19th dynasty, commencing with RAMESES I and his son Seti \nI, who reigned together, Seti I surviving as the Pharaoh of the \"Oppression\" (Exo 1 \nand 2) and dying (Exo 2:23). His mummy is now in the Boulak Museum. He was \nsucceeded by RAMESES II\u0160the Pharaoh of the Plagues and the Exodus, who was \ndrowned in the Red Sea. The change to this new dynasty is clearly seen in the \nmonuments, in the great difference between the round faces, flat noses, and thick lips \nof the 18th or Egyptian dynasty, and the long face, high cheekbones, and aquiline nose \nof the Assyrian of the 19th dynasty. Josephus speaks of \"the crown being come into \nanother family\" (Ant. ii. 9). The same is implied in the words \"a new king\" (Exo 1:8); \nnot #%dq, but Mw@q. See Deuteronomy 32:17; Judges 5:8; Daniel 2:31, 39, 44, 3:24. Many other examples might be given to show how a name, or a word, or a genealogy, or a date, may be found, which is seemingly of little or no importance in its context, and yet may throw \nwondrous light on a passage written elsewhere, and be a key to a difficulty, otherwise, \ninexplicable. \"But all these worketh that one and the self-same Spirit,\" whose infinite wisdom is seen inspiring the whole of Divine revelation and securing a uniformity in results which would be absolutely impossible in a work written separately by different writers. Let us defer for the present the subject of significance, and look at a few facts which show a manifest design pervading the whole Bible, by which various agents, writing at different \nintervals, and thus separated both by place, and time, and circumstance, are yet made to use \ncertain words a definite number of times. The actual number depends upon the special significance of the word; for the significance of the word corresponds with the significance of the number of the times it occurs. Where there is no such special significance in the meaning or use of the word, there is no special significance in the number of its occurrences. But where there is a general importance in the word, apart from its direct significance, then the word occurs according to law. All such general and important words\u0160i.e., such words on which the Holy Spirit would have us place special emphasis, or would wish us to lay special stress\u0160occur a certain number of times. \nThese are either\u0160 (1) A square number, or \n(2) A cube, or \n(3) A multiple of seven, or \n(4) A multiple of eleven.It is interesting to notice why these numbers should be thus associated together. They are \nsignificant in themselves, for seven is one of the four so-called perfect numbers, 3, 7, 10 and 12, \nas we shall see below. l     3 is the number of Divine perfection. l     7 is the number of Spiritual perfection. l     10 is the number of Ordinal perfection. l     12 is the number of Governmental perfection. The product of these four perfect numbers forms the great number of chronological perfection, 3 \nx 7 x 10 x 12 = 2520, the times of Israel's punishment, and the times of Gentile dominion over \nJerusalem.* * See The Witness of the Stars (Part II), by the same author. The association of the numbers 11 and 7 connects this arithmetical law with the geometrical, \nand calls our attention to the phenomena presented by the sides of the four primary rectilineal \nforms\u0160 In the plane, The triangle has 3 sides The square has 4 sides = 7In the solid, The pyramid has 5 sides \nThe cube has 6 sides = 11 The number 18 (the sum of these, 7 + 11) in Scripture and in nature is usually thus divided into \n7 and 11, or 9 and 9. As 7 is to 11, so is the height of a pyramid (whose base is a square) to the length of its base. \nAs 7 is to 11 expresses also the ratio between the diameter of a circle and its semi-circumference; or between a semi-circle and its chord. Further, as 18 in Scripture and in nature is divided into 7 and 11, so 7 is divided into 3 and 4 (3+4=7), and 11 is divided into 5 and 6 (5+6=11). These numbers, 3, 4, 5, and 6, are related by a perfect arithmetical progression, whose difference is unity (1). Their product gives us the well-known division of the circle into 360 \ndegrees (3x4x5x6=360)*. No one can tell us why the great circle of the heavens (the Zodiac) \nshould be divided into 360 parts, instead of any other number, for apart from this it appears to \nbe perfectly arbitrary. This is the number, however, which gives us the great Zodiacal, \nProphetic, and Biblical year of 360 days, which was given originally to Noah, and employed by \nthe Babylonians and Egyptians. * The number 360 is divisible without a remainder by all the nine digits except seven. It is the multiplication of seven of these great Zodiacal circles, or years, by seven, which gives \nus the great number expressive of chronological perfection (360x7=2520). The number 2520 is, perhaps, the most remarkable of all others, for 1.  It is the summary of all the primary rectilinear forms. 2.  It is the product of the four great numbers of completion or perfection, as shown above (for 3x7x10x12=2520). 3.  It is the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of all the ten numbers from which our system of notation is derived; for the LCM of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, is 2520. Finally, in the musical scale, as we have already seen, we again meet with these numbers seven \nand 11 as the expression of the seven primary notes and the 11 semitones. What there is of design or chance in all this we must leave to the judgment of our readers. It is sufficient for our purpose now, merely to note that these two numbers, seven and 11, have been specially selected to play so important a part;* and that there is such a remarkable relation between them must be due to design. * Why they should have been so selected we cannot tell. That there must be a peculiar adaptation in certain numbers and certain things is clear, even according to man's \nusage of them. Man speaks of \"three cheers\" and \"forty winks,\" but why no other number would do no one can tell. Why should it be these two numbers seven and 11? Why not any other two numbers? or why two at all? Why not three? We may or may not be able to explain why, but we cannot close our eyes \nto the fact. We are now merely observing phenomena and noting the working of laws. Let us \nlook first at   THE BOOKS OF THE BIBLE The Old TestamentThe Authorised Version, and indeed all printed Bibles, contain and reckon 39 separate books in the Old Testament. The Alexandrian Jews and early Christian Fathers reckoned 22 (2x11) books. This number was arbitrarily and artificially made by putting certain books together in order to make the number \nof the books agree with the number of letters in the Hebrew alphabet.* * This number 22 they obtained by arbitrarily reckoning Judges and Ruth together as \none book, and Jeremiah and Lamentations together, in addition to reckoning the double books as one, and Ezra-Nehemiah as one. But all these reckonings are of no value, none of them being based on any authority, and all of them being against the authority of the Hebrew MSS, which is all that we have to guide us in the \nmatter. In other words, the number and order of the books of the Bible come to us on precisely \nthe same authority as its facts and doctrines. In the Hebrew MSS Ezra and Nehemiah are always reckoned as one book, with the one name, Ezra. Each of the double books is reckoned as one book (e.g. 1 and 2 Samuel, 1 and 2 Kings, and 1 and 2 Chronicles), and all the minor prophets are also reckoned as one book. This makes 24 books in all. This is 8 x 3, both factors stamping the number with the seal of Divine perfection. (see under the numbers Three and Eight).* * For further information on this interesting subject see a pamphlet on The Names and Order of the Books of the Old Testament, by the same author. The New TestamentThe New Testament contains 27 separate books (3x3x3 or 33). Of these 27 books, 21 (3x7) are Epistles.   THE WRITERSIf we take the agents employed, we have 28 writers (4x7) in the Old Testament, and 8 (23) in the New Testament; or together, 36 (62). Of the 21 Epistles of the New Testament 14 (2x7) are by Paul, and seven by other writers. In this we have an argument for the Pauline authorship of the Epistle to the Hebrews; an argument which is confirmed by the numbers of verbal occurrences shown below. (See pages 37-41.)* * The following logical reasoning also supports the Pauline agency. There are four \nsteps in the argument:\u01601.  Peter wrote his First Epistle to the Diaspora, the Dispersion. See 1 Peter \n1:1. 2.  His Second Epistle was addressed to the same dispersed of Israel. See 2 \nPeter 3:1. 3.  To these same he says (2 Peter 3:15) \"our beloved brother Paul...hath \nwritten unto YOU.\" 4.  Where is this Epistle if it be not the one which is addressed to \"the \nHebrews\"? Not only do we find these phenomena in the books and the writers of the Bible, but in the \noccurrences of important words and phrases.

For the significance of this number, see under \"Thirteen.\" There is another word NazarhnoV (Nazarene), which seems to have not so much a local reference, but a moral sense. This word occurs six \ntimes,* and partakes of the moral significance of the number six. * Adding the two passages in the above note, they are Mark 1:24, 10:47, 14:67, 16:6; Luke 4:34, 24:19. This shows that the other two words refer to the city and its inhabitants, as noun and adjective; and therefore, that NazwraioV, in Matthew 2:23, has special reference to the inhabitants of the city, and \nmeans \"He shall be called a Nazarethan.\" (See \"the first fulfillment of \nprophecy in the New Testament,\" under the number \"One.\") l     ounesiV (sunesis) understanding 6 7  knowledge 1l     sperma (sperma), seed, 44 (4x11). l     meqermhneuw (methermeeneuo) interpret 5 7  be by \ninterpretation 2\"Verily\" is shown to be a weighty word. It occurs 49 times (72) in the first three Gospels* and 25 times in John (52). In the Gospel of John, however, it is always used double (\"Verily, verily\"), making 50 altogether in John, and 49 in the other three, or 99 in all (32x11). * Omitting Matthew 6:11 and Luke 23:35 with RV.

The Concordance gave only 79, overlooking Hebrew 11:23. The names of the Apostles conform to this law:\u0160 Peter occurs 245 times (72x5) Simon* (used of Peter) occurs 50 times (52x2)* The Concordance gave in this case one too many, viz., 51, but this was found to include Mark 3:18, which is another Simon (the \"Canaanite\"). James (the great) occurs 21 times (3x7) James (the less) occurs 21 times (3x7) John occurs 49 times (72) Simon Zelotes occurs 4 times (22) Matthew occurs 8 times (23) Philip occurs 16 times (42) Paul occurs 160 times (42x10) Saul (Apostle) occurs 25 times (52) Seven were called before the whole Twelve were appointed:\u0160 1.  John (John 1:35-39) 2.  Andrew (John 1:40) \n3.  Peter (John 1:41,42) \n4.  Philip (John 1:43) \n5.  Nathanael (Bartholomew) (John 1:47-51) \n6.  James (son of Zebedee) (Matt 4:21) \n7.  Matthew (John 9:9) Then the Twelve appear to have been called at seven different times:\u0160 1. Andrew and John, John 1:35-39 4 72. Peter, John 1:413. Philip, John 1:43\n4. Nathanael (Bartholomew), John 1:47-51\n5. James (son of Zebedee), Matthew 4:21 36. Matthew, Matthew 9:9\n7. The remaining five, Luke 6:13-16Here the seven is divided as usual into 4 and 3. Four being recorded in John's Gospel, and three in the other Gospels. It is probable also that they belonged to seven different families, but the relationships are too uncertain for us to speak positively. At any rate seven were brothers:\u0160Peter and Andrew; \nJames and John; James (the less), Judas (Lebbaeus or Thaddaeus), and Simon (Zelotes). Side by side with this seven-fold order, marking the number of the Apostles, there is a three-fold division of the twelve into fours. Altogether there are four (22) lists of the Apostles' names; three in the Gospels and one in the Acts. In each list the order of the names varies, but with this remarkable agreement, that the first name in each group is the same in each list, while the other three, though they are in a \ndifferent order, are never in a different group, thus:\u0160 Matt 10:2-4 Mark 3:16-19 Luke 6:14-16 Acts 1:13PETERand Andrew and James and Andrew and JamesJames and John James and Johnand John and Andrew and John and AndrewPHILIPand Bartholomew\n(1) and Bartholomew\n(1) and Bartholomew(1) and ThomasThomas and Matthew Matthew Bartholomewand Matthew and Thomas and Thomas and MatthewJAMES (son of Alphaeus)and Lebbaeus(2) and Thaddaeus(2) and Simon(3) \n(Zelotes) and Simon(3) (Zelotes)Simon(3) (Can.) and Simon(3) \n(Can.) & Judas(2) (br. of \nJas.) & Judas(2) (br. of Jas.)and Judas (Iscariot) and Judas (Iscariot) and Judas (Iscariot) Vacant(1) A patronymic for Nathanael. See John 1:44-46, where he is joined with Philip as here, and John 21:2.(2) Judas the brother of James, to distinguish him from Judas Iscariot. He was called Lebbaeus or Thaddaeus, words which have a similar meaning, courageous. (3) Canaanite, not a Gentile name, but an Aramaic word meaning the same as Zelotes. Note (1) that 4 hold the same place in each list, Judas Isacriot being always last. (2) That in Matthew and Luke the first four are arranged in pairs according to their calling and sending out; while in Mark and Acts they are placed individually according to their pre-\neminence. (3) The second four are given in Matthew, Luke, and Acts, in pairs; while in Mark they are given individually. (4) The third four are in Matthew, again given in groups; while in Mark, Luke, and Acts the order is individual. (5) That each group furnished a penman of the NT: from the first Peter and John; from the second Matthew; from the third James and Jude. The illustrations of the working of this law might be indefinitely extended. We have given merely a selection from our lists, which contain a large number of examples. Let us turn to The ApocalypseIn the Book of the Revelation of Jesus Christ, seven seems to be the predominating number, not \nonly used as a numeral, but in the occurrences of the important words:\u0160 l     \"Jesus\" occurs 14 times (2x7) (seven times alone, and seven times with \"Christ\") l     \"Lord\"* occurs 21 times (3x7) * This word kurioV gave some trouble. For the Concordance gave 22. This \nwas good enough, being 2 x 11. But being in the Apocalypse we expected a \nmultiple of seven, and this led to a more careful examination. We found that the RV omitted kurioV, on due authority, in Revelation 16:5 and 19:1, while it inserted it in 11:4 instead of the word \"God,\" thus leaving exactly 21 as above. l     \"Spirit,\" 14 times, Pneuma, 1:10, 2:7,17,29, 3:1,6,13,22, 4:5, 5:6, 11:11, 14:13, 22:17 l     axioV (axios), worthy, 3:4, 4:11, 5:2,4,9,12, 16:6 l     upomonh (hupomonee), patience, 1:9, 2:2,3,19, 3:10, 13:10, 14:12 l     sarx (sarx), flesh, 17:16, 19:18 (five times), 21 l     deka kerata (deka kerata), ten horns, 12:3, 13:1 (twice), 17:3,7,12,16 l     profhteia (propheeteia), prophecy, 1:3, 11:6, 19:10, 22:7,10,18,19 l     shmeion (seemeion), sign, 15:1 shmeion (seemeion), wonder, 12:1,3, 13:13 \nshmeion (seemeion), miracle, 13:14, 16:14, 19:20 l     asthr (asteer), star, 1:16,20 (twice), 2:1,28, 3:1, 6:13, 8:10,11,12, 9:1, 12:1,4, 22:16 (14 times) l     yuch (psuchee), life, 8:9, 12:11 yuch (psuchee), soul, 6:9, 16:3, 18:13,14, 20:4 l     kairoV (kairos), time (i.e. season), 1:3, 11:18, 12:12,14 (3 times), 22:10 l     seismoV (seismos), earthquake, 6:12, 8:5, 11:13 (twice), 19, 16:18 (twice), seven times elsewhere in NT, making 14 in all l     etoimazw (hetoimazo), make ready, 19:7 etoimazw (hetoimazo), prepare, 8:6, 9:7,15, 12:6, 16:12, 21:2 l     basileuw (basileuo), reign, 5:10, 11:15,17; 14:6, 20:4,6, 22:5, 14 occurrences elsewhere, making 21 in all l     imation (himation), garment, 3:4, 16:15 imation (himation), raiment, 3:5,18, 4:4 \nimation (himation), vesture, 19:13,16 l     abussoV (abussos), bottomless, 9:1,2 \nabussoV (abussos), bottomless pit, 9:11, 11:7, 17:8, 20:1,3 l     nefelh (nephelee), cloud, 1:7, 10:1, 11:12, 14:14 (twice), 15,16 l     tetartoV (tetartos), fourth, 4:7, 6:7 (twice), 8:12, 16:8, 21:19 \ntetartoV (tetartos), fourth part, 6:8 l     drepanon (drepanon), sickle, 14:14,15,16,17,18 (twice), 19 l     topoV (topos), place, 2:5 6:14, 12:6,8,14, 16:16, 20:11 l     makarioV (makarios), blessed, 1:3, 14:13, 16:15, 19:9, 20:6, 22:7,14 l     oxuV (oxus), sharp, 1:16, 2:12, 14:14,17,18 (twice), 19:15 l     qumoV (thumos), wrath (God's), 14:10,19, 15:1,7, 16:1 \nqumoV (thumos), fierceness, 16:19, 19:14 l     ouai (ouai), woe 8 \nouai (ouai), alas 6 [8+6=14* (2x7)] * There is another seven-fold arrangement in connection with this word; for while Bruder's Concordance gives 14 times in Revelation as noun and interjection, the word occurs 42 times elsewhere as interjection only. l     brontai (brontai), (Nom. pl.) thunders, 10:3,4, 16:18 l     brontai (brontai), (Nom. pl.) thunderings, 4:5, 8:5, 11:19, 19:6 l     akolouqew (akoloutheo), to follow, 6:8, 14:4,8,9,13, 19:14 akolouqew (akoloutheo), reach, 18:5 l     piptw (pipto), to fall down (in worship of God), 4:10, 5:8,14, 7:11, 11:16, 19:4,10 These are some examples, among many others, from one book.   PHRASES OF THE BIBLEtw$dl:w$t@ hl@e)' (aleh tol'doth), these are the generations, i.e., these are the events that time brought forth to him; (from dly (yalad), to bring forth); or these are the things or persons \nproduced by him. This phrase occurs 14 times in the Bible, 13 times in the Old Testament and \nonce in the New Testament. Genesis 11 times, of the Patriarchs, etc.Numbers \n(3:1) 1 of Aaron and MosesRuth (4:18) 1 of Pharez (David)  =    13  Matthew \n(1:1) 1 of Jesus  =    14  The first and last are used only of the \"first Adam\" and of the \"last Adam.\" But these have the \nadditional formula, \"This is the book of,\" etc. (Gen 5:1 and Matt 1:1). While the total number is 14, Genesis has 11, which divide the book into twelve sections. The first section being the Introduction, and the rest consisting of these eleven \"Tol'doth,\" making \ntwelve divisions in all, in Genesis. The eleven Tol'doth in Genesis are as follows:\u0160 1.  2:4-4:26 The Heavens and the Earth 2.  5:1-6:8 Adam \n3.  6:9-9:29 Noah \n4.  10:1-11:9 The Sons of Noah \n5.  11:10-26 Shem \n6.  11:27-25:11 Terah (not Abraham's!) \n7.  25:12-18 Ishmael \n8.  25:19-35:29 Isaac \n9.  36:1-8 Esau 10.  36:9-37:1 Esau's posterity \n11.  37:2-50:26 Jacob (not Joseph's) The Massorah calls attention to the fact that the word Tol'doth, in the Old Testament, is spelt in \ntwo ways. The first and the last occurrences (Gen 2:4 and Ruth 4:18) are spelt with two Vaus, \n(tw$dl:w$t@); the other eleven are spelt with one Vau (td&l:w$t@). Various fanciful \nexplanations of the phenomena are indulged in by Jewish Commentators. But the simple reason \nseems to lie in the fact, that the spelling of the first and last is called plene, i.e., full or complete; \nwhile the spelling of the other eleven is called defective. Thus the eleven which relate to Adam and his posterity (5:1, &c.) are stamped with defect: while the first, which relates to the heavens and the earth, tells of the perfection in which they were created; and the last, which relates to \nPharez (Ruth 4:18), contains the first mention of the name of David, and tells of the Perfect \nOne\u0160David's Son and David's Lord, who shall restore perfection to His people as well as to the \nnew heavens and the new earth. It is instructive to notice these divine divisions, and see how different they are from either man's chapters, or man's theories as to the Jehovistic and Elohistic sections, according to which some \neditor is supposed to have pieced together a number of separate documents by two different \nauthors, one of whom used the word Elohim (God), and the other Jehovah (LORD). As a matter of fact, if we take these divinely marked sections, five of them contain both titles (viz., the 2nd, 3rd, 6th, 8th, and 11th); four of them contain neither (the 5th, 7th, 9th, and 10th); \nonly the first has the combined title Jehovah Elohim (the LORD God); and only the Introduction \nhas Elohim alone; while \"Jehovah\" is used by nearly all the speakers, except the Serpent, \nAbimelech (to Abraham, not to Isaac), the sons of Heth, Pharaoh, Joseph, and his brethren. Thus, this simple fact to which we are led by the consideration of design in the employment of numbers, entirely explodes the elaborate theories of the so-called \"higher critics\" concerning \nthe Book of Genesis l     \"In all the land of Egypt\" (Myrcm Cr) lkb):\u0160 7 times in Genesis13 times in Exodus1 time in Jeremiah=  21 in all (3x7) l     \"His mercy endureth for ever\" (wdsx Mlw(l):\u0160 6 times in Chronicles1 time in Ezra34 times in Psalms1 time in Jeremiah=  42 in all (6x7)l     \"A jealous God,\" 7. l     \"The ends of the earth,\" Cr) ysp) (aphse eretz), 14. l     \"Behold (or Lo), the days come,\" 21. l     \"Thus saith the Lord GOD (or the LORD),\" 126 (7x18). l     \"As I live, saith the Lord GOD,\" 14 (all in Ezekiel). l     \"Daughter (or Daughters) of Jerusalem,\" 7 in singular; 7 plural. l     \"The tree of life\": 3 times in Genesis 4 times in Proverbs = \n7 l     \"This is a faithful saying,\" pistoV o logoV (pistos ho logos), 7 (in all in Timothy and \nTitus); 1 Tim 1:15, 3:1, 4:9,12; 2 Tim 2:11; Titus 1:9, 3:8. l     \"These things saith...\" (tade legei o...), 7 in Revelation. l     \"Children of Israel,\" 14 times in New Testament. l     \"Son of David,\" used of Christ, 14 times; with slightly different wording,* 7 = 21 (3x7). * Matt 22:42; Luke 1:32; John 7:42; Rom 1:3; 2 Tim 2:8; Rev 5:5, 22:16. l     \"And thou shalt know that I am the LORD\" occurs 7 times (1 Kings 20:13; Isa 49:23; \nEze 16:62, 25:7, 32:16, 35:4,12). We must not, however, multiply these seven-fold occurrences, because they properly come under \nour head of \"significance,\" and belong to the many illustrations of this number of spiritual \nperfection. We shall treat them more fully under the number \"Seven.\" We will close these few \nspecimens, selected from a long list of over one hundred, with the phrase, thus shown to be \nimportant:\u0160 \"As it is written\"* (kaqwV gegraptai, and wV gegraptai):* The tense is perfect, and refers not to the act of writing, or to the fact that it was once written, but to the truth that it standeth written. Matthew 1 24 with kaqwV (22x6)Mark 2Luke 1Romans 14Acts 21 Corinthians 22 \nCorinthians 2Mark 2 4 with wV (22)Luke 11 \nCorinthians 1  =  28 (22x7)Of these 28, note, that 7 are in the Gospels, and 21 in the rest of the New Testament; a seven-fold arrangement within the square numbers.   EVIDENCE AS TO AUTHORSHIPThis law, affecting the occurrence of important words, may be used in evidence as to authorship. For example, if we take certain words in Paul's Epistles alone, we do not find the \nlaw operating unless we include the Epistle to the Hebrews. If we add the occurrences in \nHebrews to those in the other Pauline Epistles, the harmony is at once restored. Omitting those \nnumbers which have their own special significance, such as 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12 ,13, etc., let \nus note the following examples of squares, cubes, 7, and 11:\u0160 The Pauline Epistles  Paul's Epistles Hebrews TotalagaphtoV (agapeetos), beloved 27 1 28 (4x7) aggeloV (angelos), angel 14 13 27 (33) aggelouV (angelous), angels (acc. pl.) 5 2 7   epaggellein (epangellein), to announce 5 4 9 (32) apeiqeia (apeitheia), unbelief 5 2 7   agein (agein), to do 7 1 8 (23) axioV (axios), worthy 8 1 9 (32) agiasmoV (agiasmos), sanctification 8 1 9 (32) aima (haima), blood 12 21 33 (3x11) apistia (apistia), unbelief 5 2 7   epaiscunesqai (epaischunesthai), \nto be ashamed 5 2 7   parateisqai (parateisthai), to shun 4 3 7   aiwnioV (aionios), eternal 21 6 27 (33) akouein (akouein), to hear 34 8 42 (6x7) alloV (allos), another 31 2 33 (3x11) arneisqai (arneisthai), to deny 6 1 7   artoV (artos), bread 10 1 11   diaboloV (diabolos), the devil 8 1 9* (32) * The number of judgment.basileuV (basileus), king 4 8 12* (22x3) *The number of governmental perfection.gennan (gennan), to beget 7 4 11   gh (gee), earth 14 11 25 (52) onoma (onoma), name 21 4 25 (52) grafein (graphein), to write 62 1 63 (7x9) desmioV (desmios), prisoner 5 2 7   desmoV (desmos), bond, fetter 8 1 9 (32) endeiknusqai (endeiknusthai), to demonstrate 9 2 11*   * Only in these Epistles. dikaiwma (dikaioma), \nrighteous act or requirement* 5 2 7   * See under the number Nine. decesqai (dechesthai), to receive 13 1 14 (2x7) apodidomai (apodidomai), to pay 8 3 11   eudokein (eudoxein), to seem good 11 3 14 (2x7) exousia (exousia), authority 27 1 28 (4x7) elegcein (elenchein), to convict 8 1 9 (32) ercesqai (erchesthai), to come 72 5 77 (7x11) eisercesqai (eiserchesthai), to enter 4 17 21 (3x7) escatoV (eschatos), last 6 1 7   proseucesqai (proseuchesthai), to \npray 20 1 21 (3x7) anecesqai (anechesthai), to endure 10 1 11   prosecein (prosechein), to attend to 5 2 7   zhtew (zeeteo), to seek 20 1 21 (3x7) qeoV (theos), God 548 68 616 (7x88) afienai (aphienai), to send away 5 2 7   anistanai (anistanai), to raise up 5 2 7   kaqistanai (kathistanai), to set down 3 4 7   kaqarizein (katharizein), to purify 3 4 7 epikaleisqai (epikaleisthai), to invoke 6 1 7   klhronomia (kleeronomia), inheritance 5 2 7   koinwnia (koinonia), fellowship 13 1 14 (2x7) eulogein (eulogein), to praise, bless 8 6 14   dialogizesqai (dialogizesthai), \nto deliberate 34 1 35 (5x7) loipoV (loipos), remaining 27 1 28 (4x7) martuV (martus), witness 9 2 11   amartia (hamartia), sin 63 25 88 (8x11) nomoV (nomos), law 119 14 133 (19x7) anomia (anomia), lawlessness 5 2 7   metanoia (metanoia), repentance 4 3 7   oran (horan), to see 4 3 7   oroV (oros), mountain 3 4 7   apeiqein (apeithein), to disbelieve 5 2 7   apistia (apistia), unbelief 5 2 7   pisteuein (pisteuein), to believe 54 2 56 (7x8) pragma (pragma), deed 4 3 7   poluV (polus), many 81 7 88 (8x11) pouV (pous), foot 10 4 14 (2x7) trwtoV (protos), first 12 9 21 (3x7) riza (rhiza), root 6 1 7   asqeneia (astheneia), sickness 12 4 16 (42) shmeion (seemeion), sign 8 1 9 (32) sperma (sperma), seed 18 3 21 (3x7) stauroV (stauros), stake (cross) 10 1 11   apostoloV (apostolos), apostle 34 1 35 (5x7) swthria (soteeria), salvation 18 7 25 (52) epitelein (epitelein), to accomplish 7 2 9 (32) uioV (tou) Qeou (huios (tou) Theou), Son of God 4 4 8 (23) teleiow (teleioo), to perfect 2 9 11   aqetein (athetein), to nullify 6 1 7   qemelioV (themelios), foundation 7 2 9 (32) proqesiV (prothesis), setting forth 6 1 7   tosoutoV (tosoutos), so great 2 5 7   tupoV (tupos), a type 8 1 9 (32) uioV (huios), a son 40 24 64 (82) uioV (huios), (applied to Christ) 17 11 28 (4x7) usterein (husterein), to lack 8 3 11   fwnh (phonee), voice 6 5 11   ferein (pherein), to bear 2 5 7   cwrizein (chorizein), to separate 6 1 7   'Isaak (Isaak), Issac 3 4 7 This list might be greatly extended, especially if we included groups of words from the same root. When we consider the same phenomena with regard to the other numbers according to their own peculiar significance,* the evidence is overwhelming as to the so-called Pauline authorship \nof the Epistle to the Hebrews. Without it the Epistles of St. Paul are only thirteen in number, \nwith it they are 14 (2x7). This principle governs the occurrences and use of words. * E.g. katecein (katechein), to hold fast, 10 + 3 = 13. See under significance of 13 and the use of this word in connectin with the Apostacy.

This would be absolutely impossible if \"one and the self-same Spirit\" had not inspired the \nwhole so as to produce such a harmonious result. The instances are very numerous, and the \nfollowing words and phrases are given merely as examples:\u0160 l     \"Hallelujah\": 24* in Psalms (22x6) 28 (22x7)4 in Revelation (22)* Viz., in seven Psalms, once each; in seven Psalms, twice each; in one three times, making 24 in all. Besides this seven-fold arrangement within the square numbers, the total of the squares yields a seven-fold result (28). l     \"Hosanna\": 1 in Old Testament* 76 in New Testament* Psalm 118:25. l     \"Shepherd,\" used of God or of Christ: (h(r), 12* in Old Test.

The half of the important Prophetic period (Daniel's last week, or the last of the 70 weeks, Dan 9:27) is mentioned seven times. This, perhaps, ought to be reserved and considered in its \nsignificance under the number \"seven.\" The point, however, now is the manner in which this \nseven is made up; for though the period is given in three different languages, two Testaments, \nand three forms (years, months, and days) the number is still seven:\u0160 Daniel 7:25, Chaldee, \"Time, and times, and the dividing of time\" 1 \nDaniel 12:7, Hebrew, \"Time, times, and an half\" 1 \nRevelation 12:14, Greek, \"Time, and times, and half a time\" 1 \nRevelation 11:2, 13:5, \"Forty and two months\" 2 \nRevelation 11:3, 12:6, Twelve hundred and sixty days 2Have we not in all this a design which is far beyond nature? A supernatural design? Numbers \nmust occur; and the only question is, Shall they be used by design or by chance? In order, or \ndisorder? According to law, or without law? In the works of God they are used always in perfect \norder. Surely then we ought to look for the same order in His Word; and be surprised if we do \nnot find it. If we look at a window of coloured glass, made after the modern fashion, with pieces of various colours put in at haphazard, we see at once that there is no design. But if we observe another \nwindow in which the pieces of glass are arranged in a perfect and intricate geometrical pattern, \nor with human or other forms, we immediately acknowledge design, and say that the hand that \nformed that window must have been guided by a head that designed the whole! This is our conclusion, then, as to the works and Word of God. Neither Moses nor any other person could have secured the above results. Moses used a certain word by Divine inspiration, \nnot knowing, in all probability, how many times he had used it. It is inconceivable that, even had \nhe known, he could have told Joshua how many times he was to use it; and that Joshua could \nhave arranged with another; and that this could have gone on for fifteen centuries and ensured \nthat the last writer should use the word only a certain definite number of times so as to secure a \nparticular result! Impossible! No! Each writer must have been ignorant as to this final result; \nbut each wrote \"as he was moved by the Holy Ghost\"; and hence, each contributed such a part \nas should end in perfecting the original design. This sweeps away as with a flood, all the puny attempts of man either in attacking or defending the inspiration of the Word of God; for that word has suffered almost as much from the unwise \ndefences of its friends, as from the malignant attacks of its enemies. \"The Law of the LORD is perfect.\"We take the high ground of making everything else submit to it. Instead of making the Bible \nagree with science, science must agree with the Bible. If it does not, it is only because it is \n\"science falsely so-called,\" and not real science. Scientia is the Latin word for knowledge. \nWhereas very much of what goes by the name of \"science\" to-day is not science at all. It is only \nhypothesis! Read man's books on this so-called science, and you will get tired of the never-\nending repetition of such words as \"hypothesis,\" \"conjecture,\" \"supposition,\" etc., etc. This is \nthe reason that such theories, which are falsely dignified by the name of science, are constantly \nchanging. We talk of the \"Science of Geology,\" or of \"Medical Science\"; but read books on geology or medicine, for example, written fifty years ago, and you will find that they are now quite \"out of date.\" But truth cannot change. Truth will never be \"out of date.\" What we know \ncan never alter! This of itself proves that the word science is wrongly used when it is applied \nonly to hypotheses, which are merely invented to explain certain phenomena. It is not for such theories that we are going to give up facts. It is not for conjectures that we are going to abandon truth. Man must offer us something better than his own thoughts if he wants us \nto give up the thoughts of God. In the Bible we have got something certain and something \nperfect. Every fact and truth which is discovered only helps to prove its truth and to exhibit its \nperfection. No monument that has ever been dug up\u0160no manuscript that has ever been \ndiscovered, has ever been other than an evidence of Bible truth! We are not afraid of any \nphenomena which may be observed in the rocks, or of any monuments or tablets which may be \ndug up from beneath them. These are not, and never have been, contrary to the Word of God. It \nis only man's interpretation of them which is against that Word, because it is only his thoughts \nwhich oppose it. \"The Law of the LORD is perfect.\"Man, and all his thoughts are imperfect; so imperfect that he has failed even to take proper care \nof God's perfect Word. Like a beautiful stained glass window which has suffered from accident, or fire, or siege, and which man has endeavoured to \"restore.\" We can see how exquisite are its colours and patterns; \nhow perfect it once was. Here and there is a tiny piece wanting, or misplaced. But it does not \nhinder us from discerning the perfection of the original geometrical figure, or from admiring the \ndelicacy of the features of the figure pourtrayed. The window is indeed marred. And one man \nhas done much to repair the injury caused by the negligence of another. We can see the defect of \nthe repairs; but we can see also that the design was originally perfect, and we praise and \nadmire the wisdom of the designer. So it is with the Word of God. Nothing can hide the perfection displayed in its design. Man has been false to his trust. He has not preserved it with the faithfulness which should ever \ncharacterise a steward. But because man has been unfaithful, we are not going to question the \nfaithfulness of God! Because man has not properly cared for this precious gift of God, we are \nnot going to question the perfection of that gift! But this is what man has done and is doing;\u0160he is charging upon God the result of his own sin, neglect, and folly! God has given man this \"bread of life,\" and he is analysing it instead of eating it! God has given man His Word, and he is criticising it instead of believing it! This is the \"wisdom\" of man \"up to \ndate.\" This is the highest flight of his wisdom\u0160\"higher criticism\"! Truly \"the world by wisdom \nknew not God\" (1 Cor 1:21). It never did and never will. Human wisdom ever leads from God. It \nis so with nineteenth century wisdom! It may seem very clever, very daring, very wise, for man \nto criticise the Word of God, but it is still true, as it is written (1 Cor 3:19).   \"THE WISDOM OF THIS WORLD IS FOOLISHNESS WITH GOD.\"Then away with man's wisdom! we do not want it. What we want is God's truth, and if man's science does not agree with God's Book, then so much the worse for his science. We will come to God's Word as those who are foolish in the eyes of the world, because we desire to be made wise unto salvation (2 Tim 3:15); and because we remember the words of the \nLord Jesus, how He said, \"Ye do err, not knowing the Scriptures\" (Matt 22:29). Whence but from Heaven could men unskilled in arts, \nIn several ages born, in several parts, \nWeave such agreeing truths? or how, or why, \nShould all conspire to cheat us with a lie? \nUnasked their pains, ungrateful their advice, \nStarving their gain, and martyrdom their price.\u0160Dryden   Back | Contents | Next  Back | Contents | Next PART II ITS SPIRITUAL SIGNIFICANCE INTRODUCTIONHaving thus shown and established the supernatural design in the use of number, both in the works of God and in the Word of God, we now come to the spiritual significance of the numbers \nthemselves. We propose to take them in order, and to give under each not merely lists of passages or things, but first to define and explain the significance of the number, and then to illustrate its meaning, \nand show its teaching, as applied to its use, to numbers of things that are mentioned, the \nnumbers of occurrences of words and things, the numbers of words used for a thing, and the \nnumbers formed by the letters of the words themselves. This last is called by the ancients \nGematria. This is the use of the letters of the alphabet instead of figures. Arabic numerals being \na comparatively modern invention were not, of course, known to, and could not have been used \nby, the more ancient nations. The Hebrews and Greeks, therefore, used their alphabets as follows:\u0160   THE HEBREW ALPHABETconsists of 22 (2 x 11) letters, so the 5 finals were added to make up three series of 9, or 27 in all: Aleph ) = 1 Yod y = 10 Koph q = 100Beth b = 2 Kaph k = 20 Resh r = 200Gimel \ng = 3 Lamed l = 30 Shin # = 300Daleth \nd = 4 Mem m = 40 Tau t = 400He h = 5 Nun n = 50 Final Kaph K = 500Vau w = 6 Samech \ns = 60 Final Mem M = 600Zayin z = 7 Ayin ( = 70 Final Nun N = 700Cheth x = 8 Pe p = 80 Final Pe P = 800Teth + = 9 Tsaddi c = 90 Final Tsaddi C = 900  THE GREEK ALPHABETThe Greek letters were 24, and the required number, 27, was made up by using the final \"V\" or V \n(called Stigma) for 6, and adding two arbitrary symbols called respectively Koppa, for 90, and \nSampsi, for 900. Alpha a =1 Iota i = 10 Rho r = 100 Beta b = 2 Kappa k = 20 Sigma s = 200 Gamma g = 3 Lambda l = 30 Tau t = 300 Delta d = 4 Mu m = 40 Upsilon \nu = 400 Epsilon \ne = 5 Nu n = 50 Phi f = 500 Stigma \nV* = 6 Xi x =60 Chi c = 600 Zeta z = 7 Omicron o = 70 Psi y = 700 Eta h = 8 Pi p = 80 Omega w = 800 Theta q = 9 Koppa = 90 Sampsi = 900 * This letter V (called Stigma) is used for the number 6. Why this letter and number should be thus associated we cannot tell, except that both are intimately connected with the ancient Egyptian \"mysteries.\" The three letters SSS (in Greek SSS) were the symbol of Isis, which is thus connected with 666. Indeed the expression of this number, CxV, consists of the initial and final letters of the word XristoV (Christos), Christ, viz., X and V, with the symbol of the serpent between them, X\u0160x\u0160V.   Back | Contents | Next  Back | Contents | Next PART II ITS SPIRITUAL SIGNIFICANCE ONEThere can be no doubt as to the significance of this primary number. In all languages it is the symbol of unity. As a cardinal number it denotes unity; as an ordinal it denotes primacy. Unity \nbeing indivisible, and not made up of other numbers, is therefore independent of all others, and \nis the source of all others. So with the Deity. The great First Cause is independent of all. All \nstand in need of Him, and He needs no assistance from any. \"One\" excludes all difference, for there is no second with which it can either harmonise or conflict. When it is written: \"Hear, O Israel, the LORD thy God is one LORD,\" it does not deny the Doctrine of the Trinity, but it excludes absolutely another Lord: it excludes, therefore, all \nidolatry. Hence the First Commandment declares \"Thou shalt have NO OTHER GODS\" (Exo 20:3). It asserts that there is in God a sufficiency which needs no other; and an independence which admits no other. It marks the beginning. We must begin with God. All our words and works must be characterised by the first words of the Bible: \"In the beginning GOD.\" Nothing is right that does \nnot begin with Him. \"God first\" is the voice of Scripture. \"Seek ye first the kingdom of God and \nHis righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you\" (Matt 6:33) is the testimony of \nChrist. \"God first\" is the great proclamation. The angels sang: \"Glory to God in the highest.\" \nThis was the beginning of their song. And it was after this that they sang of \"good-will\" towards \nman. This, too, must be the great principle governing all our testimony and our work. We cannot \ngive \"glory to God\" without doing good to men. And there is no real good-will for men which \ndoes not spring from a desire to glorify God. The rapid declension, which is the great mark of \nthese last days, comes from an ignoring of this great principle. God is shut out, and man is \nexalted. Hence \"the gospel of God\" (Rom 1:16) is being rapidly and almost universally \nsuperseded by the gospel of man, which is a gospel of sanitation, and indeed is now openly \ncalled \"Christian Socialism.\" But it is a socialism without Christ. It does not begin with the \nglory of God, and it will not and cannot end in any real good to man. It begins with man; its \nobject is to improve the old nature apart from God, and to reform the flesh; and the measure of \nits success is the measure in which man can become \"good\" without \"God.\" Man's ways and thoughts are the opposite of God's. God says, \"Seek first.\" Man says, \"Take care of number one.\" He is in his own eyes this \"number one,\" and his great aim is to be independent of God. Independence, in God, is His glory. Independence in man, is his sin, and rebellion, and shame. In the Word of God, therefore, God is first, and before all. \"Thus saith the LORD, the King of Israel, And his redeemer the LORD of hosts: \nI am the first, and I am the last; \nAnd beside Me there is no God.\" (Isa 44:6) \"Hearken unto Me, O Jacob, and Israel My called; I am He; I am the first, I also am the last. \nMine hand also hath laid the foundation of the earth, \nAnd My right hand hath spanned the heavens.\" (Isa 48:12,13) \"Before Me there was no God formed, Neither shall there be after Me. \nI, even, I, am the LORD; \nAnd beside Me there is no Saviour.\" (Isa 43:10,11) \"I am Alpha and Omega, The first and the last.\" (Rev 1:11,17, 2:8, 22:13) Thus Jehovah emphasises this great foundation truth. All must be confusion where man refuses \nto recognise it. All must be peace where it is owned. The first is the only one. There cannot be two firsts. Man ignorantly speaks of the \"two first,\" or the \"three first,\" when he really means the first two, or the first three, etc. The Word of God does \nnot thus ignorantly speak. He is the only one. He is first in priority of time. He is first in \nsuperiority of rank, and He is first in absolute supremacy. Redemption and salvation began with God. His was the word which first revealed it (Gen 3:15). his was the will which first purposed it (Heb 10:7). His was the power that alone accomplished \nit. Hence \"Salvation is of the LORD\" (see Exo 14:13; 2 Chron 20:17; Jonah 2:9; etc.). His is the \nwill from which it all proceeds. \"Lo, I come to do Thy will,\" said the Redeemer (Psa 40:7,8; Heb \n10:7) when He came to do that \"will.\"   THE FIRST RECORDED WORDS OF THE LORD JESUSare full of significance. \nHere is another illustration of the significance of number in Scripture. The Lord Jesus must have spoken from the time that all children spoke; but not one syllable that He uttered has the Holy Spirit been pleased to record in the Scriptures, until He was twelve years of age. And then \nonly this one utterance from His birth till He entered on His ministry at His baptism. Only one \nsentence out of all those twenty-nine years. Surely words thus singled out by the Holy Spirit \nmust be full of significance. What were they? They are written down for us in Luke 2:49: \"WIST \nYE NOT THAT I MUST BE ABOUT MY FATHER'S BUSINESS?\" Solemn words! Significant \nwords! Especially in the light these first words throw up His last words, \"IT IS FINISHED.\" \nWhat was finished? \"The Father's business.\" Yes, it was the Father's will. \"Lo, I come to do Thy \nwill, O My God.\" \"This is the Father's will which hath sent Me, that of all which He hath given \nMe I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day\" (John 6:39). Salvation \nwas no afterthought with God. It was part of his \"eternal purpose.\" It originated in His \"will.\" It \nwas not merely for the good of man, but for the glory of God in a thousand ways which we see \nnot now or yet. Hence it is that when Jesus was delivering up His work back into the Father's \nhands, He could say: \"I have glorified Thee on the earth: I have finished the work which Thou \ngavest Me to do\" (John 17:4). We may find another illustration of the significance of the number \"one\" or \"first\" in noticing   THE FIRST MINISTERIAL WORDS OF THE LORD JESUSAt His baptism (Matt 3:13-17) He was anointed for His ministry, and immediately after we read: \"THEN was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the Devil.\" For \nforty days He fasted and was tempted. Not a word that escaped His lips during those forty days \nis written down. But the very first recorded words of his ministry are: \"It is written.\" Three times \nover: \"It is written\"; \"It is written\"' \"It is written.\" His official ministry closed with His High-Priestly prayer to the Father in John 17, for at its close He went out into the Garden of Gethsemane to His betrayal, and within a few hours His \ndeath. In those last words of His ministry there is the same threefold reference to the Word of \nGod: 5:17, \"Thy word is truth\"; v. 14, \"I have given them Thy word\"; and v. 8, \"I have given \nunto them the words which Thou gavest Me.\" What does this fact say to us? If we have ears to hear, it says The beginning and end of all ministry is the Word of God. Yea, it is the whole sum and substance of ministerial testimony. The \nLord thus exalted the Word of God, and by the significance of His first ministerial words He \nimpresses upon us this great lesson.   THE FIRST BOOKof the Bible also affords us another illustration. In Genesis we see Divine sovereignty and supremacy. Sovereignty in Creation, in giving life, and in sustaining life. The name by which God specially revealed Himself to the Patriarchs, He says (Exo 6:3), was El-Shaddai (God Almighty). This Title occurs In Genesis 6 times = 9 (32)Rest of Pentateuch 3 timesnine times in all; the square of three, the number of Divine perfection. The first occurrence of the name \"Almighty\" is also full of instruction, but we shall consider it under the number \"five.\" All through this first Book we see this Divine supremacy and sovereignty\u0160sovereignty of will in election and calling: calling Abram and no other (Acts 7:2); choosing Isaac and not Ishmael \n(Gen 17:18-21); Jacob and not Esau (ibid. 25:23, etc.); Ephraim and not Manasseh (ibid. \n48:19; Heb 11:21). This first book is the one book. It contains all the other books in embryo, and has been well called \"the seed plot of the Bible.\" Its Divine title is \"THE BEGINNING,\" i.e., the first: \"In the \nbeginning God,\" i.e., God first. Here is the beginning of life, the beginning of prophecy (Gen \n3:15). The woman's seed foretold, and the beginning of the enmity between her seed and the \nseed of the serpent. The covenant made with Abraham (Gen 15) was unconditional, because there was only one contracting party. The Law had a mediator, therefore there were two parties to that covenant. \n\"But a mediator is not of one [contracting party*], but God is one\" (Gal 3:20). God alone made \nthis covenant, hence it is called \"the covenant of PROMISE.\" * The ellipsis is wrongly supplied in Gal 3:20. It is not the word mediator which is to be repeated, but the contracting party from v. 19. Then we have the sufferings of Christ, and the glory which should follow, foreshown in Joseph. His death as a substitute is foreshown in Isaac's ram. \"The way of Cain\" and the way of God are \nseen in Cain's fruits and Abel's lamb, showing the true and only ground of access to and \nworship of God. Thus in the forefront of revelation we are shown that man cannot be saved by works, but by grace alone. The foundation of all truth is here. Gospel truth shines brightly here. All is in one \nbook, and that the first.   THE FIRST COMMANDMENT\"This is the first and great commandment,\" Matthew 22:37, 38, or in Mark 12:29, 30, \"Hear, O Israel; the LORD our God is one LORD: thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thy heart, \nand with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength.\" The reference is to Deuteronomy 6:4. This is \"first\" in order, first in time, and first in importance. This is therefore the \"greatest\" in necessity, in extent, and in nature. The first in the \nLaw, and the greatest in the Law, and hence it was one of the four passages written on the \nphylacteries of the Jews. The Hebrew words may be variously rendered, but the quotation of the Lord Jesus, written by the Holy Spirit in the Gospels, fixes the meaning of the words. In the Hebrew the order is, \n\"Hear, O Israel, Jehovah our Elohim, Jehovah One.\" The Jews repeat it to-day thus, \"Hear, O \nIsrael, the LORD our God, the LORD is One,\" and the whole congregation repeat the word \n\"One\" for several minutes.* * As \"Elohim\" is plural we might with much more reason repeat \"Elohenu\" for several minutes! If the Lord had not supplied the verb which fixes the meaning, we might well have read it as the Jews do, for this fixes (unconsciously to them) the doctrine of the Trinity. For the three Persons \nare named, and then it is declared that they are one: \"The Lord, our God, The Lord, is one,\" i.e., \nthe three, Father, Son, and Spirit, are one. But there is a further peculiarity in this passage. In all the MSS and printed texts the last letters of the first and last words are always written and printed majuscular, i.e., larger than the \nothers; thus: \"ShemA Israel, Jehovah, Elohenu, Jehovah, EchaD.\"In the Hebrew the first of these two larger letters is ( (ayin), and the second is d (daleth). Rabbi \nBochin has this remark, \"It is possible to confess one God with the mouth, although the heart is \nfar from Him. For this reason ( and d are majuscula, from which, with tsere subscribed d( 'a \nwitness,' is formed, that every one may know, when he professes the unity of God, that his heart \nought to be engaged and free from every other thought, because God is a witness and knows all \nthings\" (J. H. Mich., Bibl. Hebr.). What may be the true reason, however, for these two letters \nbeing larger, we do not know. The real sense of the words, according to their meaning, is, Hear, \nO Israel, Jehovah (the ever-existing One) our Elohim (our Triune God), Jehovah \"is one.\" What is here predicated of Jehovah is not the unity of God at all, but that it is to Him that the name Jehovah rightfully belongs, that He is the one and only God, and that there can be no \nother. It is equally opposed to all forms of Theism and Deism, which are the creations of man's \nideas, as well as to polytheism on the one hand, and national or local deities on the other. The \nwhole statement has regard to revelation. Israel alone could say, Jehovah is \"our God,\" because \nHe had made Himself known\u0160\"His ways unto Moses, and His acts to the children of \nIsrael\" (Psa 103:7). With this agrees the choice of the word Echad, which is used for \"one.\" In the Hebrew there are two words in use for the number \"one.\" dxaf)e (Echad), \"one,\" unus; and dyxiyaf (Yacheed), \"an \nonly one,\" unicus. The latter, Yacheed (dyxiyaf), means absolute unity, or uniqueness, an only one. It occurs only twelve times in the Old Testament (3x22), viz: Pentateuch, 3 Rest of Old Testament 9 (32).l     Genesis 22:2, \"Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac.\" l     Genesis 22:12 and 16, \"Hast not withheld thy son, thine only son.\" l     Judges 11:34, \"She was his only child.\" l     Psalm 22:20, \"Deliver...my darling\" (marg. only one). l     Psalm 25:16, \"I am desolate and afflicted.\" l     Psalm 35:17, \"Rescue...my darling (marg. only one) from the lions.\" l     Psalm 68:6, \"God setteth the solitary in families.\" l     Proverbs 4:3, \"I was...tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother.\" l     Jeremiah 6:26, \"Mourning as for an only son.\" l     Amos 8:10, \"I will make it as the mourning of an only son.\" l     Zechariah 12:10, \"As one that mourneth for his only son.\" These are all the occurrences of the word Yacheed, and here therefore we see the meaning of the word. But this is not the word which is used in Deuteronomy 6:4, and it is never used of \nJehovah. It is used of the Lord Jesus as the only begotten Son; but never of Jehovah\u0160the Triune \nGod. But dxaf)e (Echad) is so used because it does not mean absolute unity, but a compound unity. Always one of others which make up the one. Its first occurrence is:\u0160 l     Genesis 1:5, \"The first day\" (of seven). l     Genesis 2:11, \"The name of the first is Pison\" (i.e. one of four). l     Genesis 2:21, \"He took one of his ribs.\" l     Genesis 2:24, \"They two shall be one flesh.\" Hence when it is used twice, the word being repeated, \"one, one,\" it is translated both one and \nthe other; but it is always one where there are others. (Hence sometimes each, as in Num 7:85). l     Genesis 49:16, \"As one of the (twelve) tribes of Israel.\" l     Numbers 13:23, \"A branch with one cluster of (many) grapes.\" We even have the plural Echadim (like Elohim), ones. In speaking of the two sticks representing \nthe houses of Israel and Judah, it says, Ezekiel 37:19, \"They shall become ones in Thine hand.\" l     Psalm 34:20, \"He keepeth all his bones, not one of them is broken.\" In all these and other places Echad is composite. It is one of others, and hence it is the word \nused in Deuteronomy 6:4. Jehovah (the Father), Elohim (the Son), and Jehovah (the Spirit) is \nEchad:\u0160One Triune God. This is the teaching of the number one as applied to this first commandment. There is only one Lord, consequently there is no other to divide the heart. Therefore thou shalt love the Lord with all thy heart. Thus the ground of the claim is first mentioned, and then this first and great commandment is given, based upon it. But this leads to another illustration in Zechariah 14:9.   THE ONE MILLENNIAL RULE\"And the LORD shall be King over all the earth; In that day shall there be one LORD, and His name one.\"There will in that glorious day be no one to dispute Jehovah's rule. There will be no difference \nof law, or will, or rule, then. All will be harmony, unity, and agreement. This is the secret of \nMillennial peace. In the Lord's Prayer the two are placed together, one being consequent upon \nthe other. \"Thy kingdom come.\" \n\"Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.\"Where there are more wills than one, there can be no peace, no rest. There must necessarily be \nconflict and confusion. This is the secret of all disturbance in families, parties, and nations. We sometimes hear of a \"Dual Control,\" but it is a fiction. It exists only in words, not in reality! \nThis is the secret of rest for the heart now\u0160\"One will.\" As long as there are two wills there can be no peace. As long as our will is not subject to God's will, we cannot know what rest is. This is where the Lord Jesus, as man, found rest in the midst of His rejection. In Matthew 11, John the Baptist doubts, vv. 2, 3; the people of that generation reject Him, vv. 16-19; the cities \nwhich saw His mightiest works do not believe, vv. 20-24. Then we read in the next verses \n(25,26), \"AT THAT TIME Jesus answered and said, I THANK THEE, O FATHER, Lord of \nheaven and earth, because Thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast \nrevealed them unto babes, EVEN SO FATHER; for so it seemed good in Thy sight.\" And then \nturning to his weary servants, the subjects of similar trials and disappointments, He says, \n\"Come unto Me, all ye that labour and are heavy-laden, and I will give you rest.\" In other words, rest is to be found only in subjection to the Father's will. This is the secret of present rest for our souls. This is the secret of Millennial peace and blessing for the earth. How simple! and yet what strangers we are to this rest! How the Lord's servants are rushing hither and thither to find this great blessing, and yet do not enter into it! Why is this? It is \nbecause we do not believe that His will is better than our own? If we were occupied with the \nLord instead of with ourselves, with the Blesser instead of with our \"blessing,\" we should soon have such a sense of His grace and glory and power as would convince us that His will is better than ours; and then, instead of being busy with ourselves and enquiring how we are to give up \nour will, we should see that His is so good that we really loathe our own, and desire only His. This blessing is not gained by any \"act of surrender\" or \"act of faith,\" but our own will simply vanishes in the contemplation of his will as we see it to be all-gracious and all-good. Man's modern methods all begin at the wrong end. They begin with ourselves, they occupy us with ourselves, and hence the failure. The Divine method puts \"God First,\" and thus the end is \nassured. It is when our hearts are so before God and so with God, that we learn the wondrous wisdom of His way, and the perfection, sweetness, and blessedness of His will. We yearn to possess it, we \nlong for it, and desire to come into its joy; and our own will vanishes without an effort, and \nwithout our knowing it, until we discover afterwards what has happened by a happy experience. In Millennial days this will be the blessing of the whole earth. For in that day there shall be one King, one will, \"one Lord, and His name one.\"   THE UNITY OF THE SPIRITThis is the unity of the members of the one body of Christ, who are all animated by the same Spirit. It is a unity which we cannot make. It is made for us in Christ. We can only preserve it, \nand live in the power of it by the Holy Spirit, who is \"the bond of peace.\" It needs indeed \ncarefully preserving, for it is opposed to all man's ideas of unity in churches and sects. It is a \nspiritual unity. In Ephesians 4:4-6 this unity of the body and its members is set forth. And note the seven-fold nature of it. It is set forth in an Epanodos, i.e., the sentences are arranged in an introversion, \nwhere the first answers to the last, the second to the next to the last, etc. The Lord is exalted by \nbeing placed in the centre of the whole. A. There is one BODY,B. and one SPIRIT, C.Even as ye are called [also] in one HOPE \nof your calling:D. ONE LORD, C. One FAITH. B. One BAPTISM. A. One God and Father of all [the members of this Body], who is above [or over you] all, and through [or with you] all, and in you all. Here note, then, in A and A, we have the one Body. In B and B, we have the Spirit and His \nBaptism. In C and C, the graces of \"faith\" and \"hope\"; while in D the Lord stands out as the \ngreat head of this one Body, the keystone of this arch of Divine truth.   FIRST OCCURRENCES OF WORDSThese are always important. The ancient Jewish commentators call special attention to them, and lay great stress upon them as always having some significance. They generally help us in \nfixing the meaning of a word or point us to some lesson in connection with it. Take for example the word\u0160 \"Hallelujah\"Where does it first occur? Psalm 104:35:\u0160 \"Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, And let the wicked be no more. \nBless thou the LORD, O my soul, \nHALLELUJAH.\"And where is the first occurrence in the New Testament? Revelation 19:1-3, \"I heard a great \nvoice of much people in heaven, saying ALLELUIA;* salvation, and glory, and honour, and \npower** unto the Lord our God; for true and righteous are His judgments; for He hath judged \nthe great whore, which did corrupt the earth with her fornication, and hath avenged the blood of \nHis servants at her hand, and again they said ALLELUIA.\"*** * This is the Greek spelling of the Hebrew word \"Hallelujah.\"** The repetition of this word \"and\" is an example of the figure of Polysyndeton. \n*** This is an example of the figure of Repetition called Epanadiplosis, where the same word that begins the sentence is repeated at the end, for the sake of emphasis, and to call our attention to some important lesson in connection with it. In both these cases, in the Old Testament and in the New, the first occurrence of the word \"Hallelujah\" stands in connection with judgment. It is for this that praise is given to God. This \ndoes not accord with the teachings of the false charity and the traitorous toleration of the \npresent day. The servants of Jehovah, who are imbued with the spirit of the Scriptures, are to, \nand can, praise Him for the destruction of His and their enemies. \"Prophet\"The first occurrence of this word stands in connection with Abraham, Gen 20:7. God says to Abimelech king of Gerar, concerning Abraham and his wife, \"Now therefore restore the man his \nwife: for he is a PROPHET, and he shall pray for thee and thou shalt live.\" We learn from this that the word Prophet does not mean merely one who foretells, but one who witnesses for God as His spokesman. The Hebrew word occurs in Exodus 7:1, \"Aaron thy \nbrother shall be thy prophet\"; while in 4:16 the same word is translated, \"he shall be thy \nspokesman.\" This is exactly what it means; and the man who spoke for God was recognised by \nthe people as God's man, i.e., \"A man of God.\" \"Holy\"The first occurrence of #dq (Ko-desh), holy, is in Exodus 3:5. Not in the Book of the Beginning \n(Genesis); not until Exodus is opened\u0160the Book of Redemption, which records how God came \ndown to redeem His people out of Egypt (Exo 15:13). The creature cannot understand anything \nabout holiness except on the ground of redemption. \"Bride\"The first occurrence of the word \"bride,\" hlk (Kalah), as applied to the Bride of Jehovah, is in \nIsaiah 49:18. This fixes the meaning of the term as applying only to Israel, and not to the \nChurch, which is \"the Body of Christ,\" part of \"Christ mystical\"; in other words, part of the \nBridegroom. We are thus pointed to the fact that Israel is the Bride. Compare Isaiah 61:10, \n62:5. \"The Day of the Lord\"This important expression occurs first in Isaiah 2:12, and if we read the description of it as \nthere given to us by the Holy Spirit, and note its character and object, as well as the purpose of \nit, we shall have a clear understanding of its meaning. It is the day when the LORD ariseth to shake terribly the earth; when man shall be humbled and brought low; and when God alone shall be exalted. Read the whole passage Isaiah 2:10-22, and note how it is emphasised, and how its importance is further shown by being stamped throughout with two figures, which run side by \nside,\u0160Polysyndeton, the word \"and\" being used twenty times in nine verses, and Synonymia, i.\ne., where different words of similar meaning are heaped together and repeated. Here there are \nseven words and twenty repetitions of them in order to show the loftiness of man's natural pride, \nand the depth to which it shall be brought down and humbled in \"the Day of the LORD.\" This is the first occurrence of the expression:\u0160 \"For the day of the LORD of hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and lofty, And upon every one that is lifted up; and he shall be brought low...; \nAnd the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.\" (v 11)  THE FIRST QUESTIONSof the Old and New Testaments are also full of instruction.* * Gen 3:1 is not a question, as the margin explains. Genesis 3:9, \"Where art thou?\" This question was put by God to the sinner who is hiding from His holy presence, to bring him to conviction, to show him that he was lost and guilty and ruined. This is the object of the Old \nTestament. The Law it is that gives the knowledge of sin, and brings the sinner under conviction. The first commandment is, \"Thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thy heart,\" etc. The impossibility of obeying this commandment convicts the sinner of his impotence, and causes him \nto thankfully cast himself upon God's omnipotence, and cry out for a Saviour. The first question of the New Testament therefore is, in Matthew 2:2, \"Where is HE that is born?\" Where is this Saviour whom I need? He has sought me and brought me to conviction. \nWhere is He that I might find Him, and know Him, and worship Him, and serve Him?   THE FIRST FULFILLMENT OF PROPHECY IN THE NEW TESTAMENTThis opens a vast field of instruction, laying down for us the lines, and showing us the principles on which the Holy Spirit interprets His own prophecy. It is in the Gospel according to Matthew \n(1:22,23): A. \"Now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of (upo, by) the Lord by (dia, through) the prophet, saying,B. Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son. B. and they shall call His name Emmanuel, A. which being interpreted is, God with us.\"* * Note that in this introversion we have, in A and A, the prophecy and the interpretation; while in B and B we have the prophecy fulfilled; in B His birth, and in B His name. Here notice, first, that the prophecy is quoted from Isaiah 7:14. In Matthew it is specially said to be \"spoken by the Lord\"; and in Isaiah it is written, \"The LORD Himself shall give you a sign.\" Thus the fact is emphasised that \"the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man; but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost\" (2 Peter 1:21). As this is the first recorded fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy in the New Testament, we may expect to find in it the generic character of all prophecy, and the grand example of the Holy \nSpirit's own interpretation. The prophecy here said to be fulfilled is thus written in Isaiah 7:14: \"Behold a virgin* shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call His name Immanuel.\" * The RV thus translates it like the AV, but gives in the margin: \"the maiden is with \nchild and beareth.\" The verbs occur twice besides, Gen 16:11 and Judg 13:5,7; and v \n12 shows that birth was imminent. The noun virgin is hmafl:(ahaf Ha-almah, and \nmeans the \"maiden,\" or the \"damsel.\" Almah occurs seven times, Gen 24:43; Exo 2:8; \nPsa 68:25; Pro 30:19; Song 1:3, 6:8; Isa 7:14, and means \"a maid\" or \"unmarried \nwoman.\" Here it is \"the maid,\" i.e., some particular maid well known to the prophet \nand to Ahaz, but not to us. The Hebrew for virgin in our technical sense is haflw@tb@:, Bethulah (and occurs 50 (2x52) times; the first, Gen 24:16). The truth is that every Bethulah is indeed an Almah; but every Almah is not necessarily a Bethulah. The prophecy does not lose one fraction of its Messianic character and \nforce by this admission of the truth, as we shall see below. When it was filled in the \ndays of Ahaz it was merely Almah; but when it was fulfilled or filled full, the Holy Spirit interprets it by the Greek word parqenoV, and thus defines her as technically a virgin. But there is another prophecy associated with this, which is recorded in the next chapter: \"The king of Assyria...shall sweep onward into Judah; He shall overflow and pass through... \nAnd the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land, O \nImmanuel. \nMake an uproar, O ye peoples, and ye shall be broken in pieces;... \nTake counsel together, and it shall be brought to nought; \nSpeak the word, and it shall not stand; \nFor GOD IS WITH US (l)' w@nm@af(i, Immanu-el).\" (Isa 8:7-10, RV)Now in this first quotation of prophecy as fulfilled, we note the following facts for our \ninstruction:\u0160 1. Prophecy is, as we have seen, spoken by JEHOVAH, and the prophets, so-called, are only the instruments or agents. With this agrees 2 Peter 1:20, 21, where it is said that they \"spake as they \nwere moved by the Holy Ghost.\" Now the word Jehovah denotes Him who existed in eternity past, and will ever exist in eternity to come. In the Old Testament we have the word (Jehovah) which implies the interpretation. While in the Apocalypse we have the interpretation which implies the word \"which is, and which was, and \nwhich is to come\" (1:4,8, 4:8). The Name of the \"Lord,\" or Jehovah, therefore, is the key to the understanding of His Word, for He has magnified His Word above all His Name (Psa 138:2). His Word, therefore, in a still \nhigher sense, will relate to what WAS, and IS, and is TO COME. Notice, however, that in the New Testament (the Apocalypse) Jehovah Jesus, as the Son of Man, is about to fulfil all His holy promise, and carry out all his responsibility. Hence His name is\u0160 In the OT\u0160He shall be, He is, He was \nIn Apocalypse\u0160He shall be, He is, He was, He is to come.The future has become present, and what was present merges into the past. The present is, in the Greek, expressed by the participle (not the indicative, which is only suitable to a definite beginning or ending), thus indicating the protracted fulfillment of prophecy \nbetween the past and the future, running from the announcement of the prophecy down to the \nperiod of the crisis. In the Apocalypse the three-fold statement occurs twice more (11:17, 16:5). But these refer to the period after the Coming of Christ, and hence the future aspect of His name disappears. He is \nspoken of only as \"which art, and wast.\"* * The words \"and art to come\" were put in by some later copyist from the earlier part \n(1:4,8), and have no manuscript authority. They are excluded by Griesbach, \nLachmann, Tischendorf, Tregelles, Alford, Wordsworth, Westcott and Hort, and the RV. It will then be simply the one \"who is and was.\" The coming is regarded as having taken place, and the Day of the Lord inaugurated; therefore nothing future in the name remains in relation \nto the prophetic word. Thus the fact that the words were \"spoken by Jehovah\" gives us the first key to their prophetic unfolding. 2. The subject of the prophecy is Christ, for \"the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy\" (Rev 19:10). 3. This prophecy was originally uttered in connection with man's failure as man, in the person of Ahaz (Isa 7:10-14). Just as the prophecy of Genesis 3:15 was given in connection with man's failure in Adam; and just as the prophets were first raised up as a special order of witnesses on Israel's failure. The Holy Spirit thus connects in this prophecy the failure of man and the \npromise of the Messiah, taking the different threads of His various utterances, and combining \nthem in one. Thus establishing the principle that prophecy came in after man's failure. 4. On the other hand, He takes the words out of those combinations which were the direct cause of their original utterance. Thus prophecy is resolved into its elements by the Holy Spirit, and by \nHim the elements are re-combined in accordance with His plans. 5. He takes up the threads of passages that follow the one actually quoted, which explain the reason why the original combinations in which the words were written did not allow of the \ncomplete fulfillment of the prophecy at the time they were spoken or written. 6. He connects meanings of names with prophetic truth; and, seizing the gist of the prophecy rather than the mere words, He views in Ahaz the idolatrous and unbelieving Jews making a \ncovenant with their Gentile enemy. 7. He develops, defines, and adds to the original force of the Hebrew word Almah, because, in the ultimate fulfillment, the woman to bring forth the son would be a virgin. The use of Almah in \nIsaiah made it correct for the historic fulfillment, but did not thus preclude the Futurist \nfulfillment. 8. The whole prophecy, therefore, of Isaiah 7 and 8 can receive its fulfillment only by separating that fulfillment into three parts, Preteritist, Presentist, and Futurist. Then, as the speaker is \nJehovah, the LORD, as we have seen, it is interpreted according to the meaning of His name, \nwhich embodies past, present, and future, as the ever-existing and eternal God, \"which is, and \nwhich was, and which is to come\" (Rev 1:4,8). It follows, therefore, from this that no interpretation of prophecy can be correct which confines itself to only one of these three parts, and denies the other two. This is not \"rightly dividing the \nword of truth.\" And also it follows that the power thus to divide the prophecy and re-combine the three divisions must be only that of the author of the prophecy, the LORD the Spirit. Interpreters who take up one of these three principles are therefore divided into opposite and hostile camps against those who take up another of those principles. But not until we grasp the \ngreat principle laid down by the Holy Spirit here, and apply all of them, and all of them \ntogether, can we have a true understanding of prophecy. Now let us prove these three principles. First\u0160The PreteritistAhaz, being greatly moved at the confederacy of Ephraim with Syria, was tempted to make a counter-confederacy with the king of Assyria. A sign was given to him that he need not yield to \nthe temptation, for it would be withdrawn. A child would be born to a certain maiden, who would be called Immanuel, and before that child would know how to distinguish between good and evil, the land that he abhorred (i.e., Ephraim and Syria, regarded as one) would be forsaken \nof both her kings. In the next chapter another sign was given to Ahaz. Again a child would be born, this time to the prophetess, and called Maher-shalal-hash-baz, and before he should be able to cry \"father\" or \n\"mother,\" both Syria and Ephraim should be spoiled by the king of Assyria. The words quoted in Matthew 1 are taken partly from Isaiah 7:14; and they distinctly show that Ahaz had not to wait for the birth of Christ to see the promised \"sign,\" but that it must have \noccurred in his own day. And it was so. Herein is the Preteritist interpretation fulfilled in the \npast. Second\u0160The FuturistBut part of the quotation in Matthew 1, \"God with us,\" is taken from Isaiah 8:10, which clearly \nreaches forward to the same time as Psalm 2, when the kings of the earth take counsel against \nMessiah, and is, therefore, exclusively futurist. \"The king of Assyria...shall sweep onward into Judah:... \nAnd the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of Thy land, O \nImmanuel. \nMake an uproar, O ye peoples, and ye shall be broken in pieces: \nAnd give ear, all ye of far countries: \nGird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces; \nGird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces. \nTake counsel together, and it shall be brought to nought; \nSpeak the word, and it shall not stand: \nFor GOD IS WITH US (Immanu El). \nFor the LORD spake thus to me with a strong hand, \nAnd instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this people.\" (Isa 8:8-12, \nRV)This is continued in v. 21, and is evidently futurist, as it is the time of darkness, when the \njudgments of the Apocalypse are upon the earth. (See Isa 8:8-9:7) \"She that was in anguish\" in 9:1 is clearly Zion, and it is Zion, or the nation, that will at the time of the end say: \"Unto us a child is born.\" That is the time of Revelation 12 and Psalm 87, where \nChrist is seen as born of Zion. It is the time when He takes the kingdom and establishes His \nmillennial reign (Luke 1:31-33). Thus it is certain that a portion of these three chapters cannot be fully interpreted except on Futurist lines. Third\u0160The Presentistlines, or those which run through the ages between the past (the prophet's own day) and the future (the day of the crisis), are also clearly discernible. In 7:17 we read the words, immediately following the prophecy of the birth of this mysterious child:\u0160 \"The LORD shall bring upon thee, \nAnd upon thy people, and upon thy father's house, \nDays that have not come, \nFrom the day that Ephraim departed from Judah; \nEven the king of Assyria.\" (Isa 7:17)To understand this, it is necessary to know that Nebuchadnezzar stepped into the heritage of the \nkings of Assyria. Hence the Babylonians were called Assyrians, even so late as the times of \nXenophon, who so speaks of them in his Anabasis. And even Darius, whom we know was a \nMedian, is still called \"the king of Assyria\" in the Word of God. (See Ezra 6:22, and compare 2 \nKings 23:29 and 2 Chron 35:23.) Thus \"the Assyrian\" of Isaiah's prophecy, at the time of the end, is not necessarily a king of revived Assyria, and we are taught that these prophecies of the king of Assyria reach through to \nall the heads of the four Gentile empires spoken of in Daniel. The prophecy of the king of Assyria spoken of in these chapters of Isaiah runs on in protracted presentist fulfillment, covering the whole period of \"the times of the Gentiles.\" Another proof of the necessity of this presentist fulfillment is given in Isaiah 8:13:\u0160 \"The LORD of hosts, Him shall ye sanctify; And let Him be your fear, and let Him be your dread. \nAnd He shall be for a sanctuary; \nBut for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence to both the houses of \nIsrael, \nFor a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem. \nAnd many shall stumble thereon, and fall, and be broken, \nAnd be snared and be taken. \nBind thou up the testimony, \nSeal the law (or teaching) among my disciples. \nAnd I will wait for the LORD, \nThat hideth His face from the house of Jacob, \nAnd I will look for Him. \nBehold! I and the children whom the LORD hath given me \nAre for signs and wonders in Israel \nFrom the LORD of hosts, which dwelleth in mount Zion.\" (Isa 8:13-18, RV)Here we have the present character of the dispensation as it is described in Romans 9-11, the \nperiod of Israel's blindness. This is perfectly clear if we compare Isaiah 8:14 with Romans 9:32, \n33. Christ is the stumbling-stone and rock of offence to the masses; but He is believed on by a remnant of His disciples, \"the remnant according to the election of grace.\" Christ and His \ndisciples today are the Lord's \"signs and wonders\" to Israel, for the disciples are counted as the \nLord's \"children\":\u0160 \"A seed shall serve him; \nIt shall be accounted to the LORD for a generation.\" (Psa 22:30)** It is clear also from Heb 2:13, that Isa 8:18 had both a preteritist and then a futurist fulfillment. This is further set forth in the meanings of all the names employed. The salvation of Jehovah (for such is the meaning of the name ISAIAH) will be accomplished by Jehovah being with His \npeople (IMMANUEL). That salvation is needed and brought about in consequence of the \nAssyrian hasting to make a prey and spoil of the nation (MAHER-SHALAL-HASH-BAZ). Then \nthe remnant shall return, i.e. repent (SHEAR-JASHUB, Isa 7:3), and stay upon Jehovah and \nwait for Him. Such is the purport and teaching of the whole Prophecy of Isaiah; for it is but one prophecy, a whole, complete in its parts, the \"higher criticism,\" which would saw him asunder, notwithstanding. Such, too, is the important lesson taught us by this first recorded fulfillment of prophecy in the New Testament, from which we learn that prophecy is only comprehensible as an organic \nwhole, when thus subdivided by (and by us under the guidance of) the Holy Spirit into its \nPreteritist, Presentist, and Futurist fulfillments according to the meaning of the name \nJehovah\u0160\"which is, and which was, and which is to come.\"   WORDS THAT OCCUR ONLY ONCEare often instructive; they are called by the Greeks apax legomena (hapax legomena). We give a few examples in detail. (1) kritikoV (kritikos), \"critic,\" Hebrews 4:12This is the origin of our word \"critic.\" The Greek is kritikos, and \"critic\" is merely the English \nspelling of the Greek word, which is thus transliterated. It means able to judge or skilled in \njudging; and then, simply, a judge, but always with the idea of his ability to judge. It occurs only \nin Hebrews 4:12, where it is translated \"a discerner.\" The whole passage relates both to the written Word, which is a sword (Eph 6:17): and to the living Word (Christ), who has a sword. The structure of the two verses distinguishes between God and His word:\u0160 A. 12-. GOD it is whose Word is so wonderful.B. -12-. What His Word IS (living, powerful, and a sharp sword). C. -12-. What His Word DOES (piercing and \ndividing asunder, etc.). B. -12-. What His Word IS (a skillful judge). A. 13. GOD it is who is omniscient. Here we have in A and A, God the omniscient one; and in B, C, and B we have His Word. And \nwe learn that the Word of God is a judge now, so wonderful that it distinguishes between the \nthoughts and intentions of the heart and judges them. The Lord Himself bears witness that the same Word will be our judge hereafter\u0160John 12:48, \"He that rejecteth Me, and receiveth not My words, hath one that judgeth him; the Word which I \nhave spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.\" What a solemn truth. And how much more solemn, when man now dares to take this one word \"critic\" or \"judge,\" which God has thus, by His only once using it, appropriated to His Word, \nand apply it to himself. And what is it that man is going to judge? Why, this very Word of God! \nthus making himself the judge of that Word which is to judge him! If the word kritikos were of \nfrequent occurrence, and used of various things or persons, man might perhaps be led to look \non himself as a judge of some one of them. But God has used it only once, and He has thus \nconfined it to one thing\u0160His Word. Therefore it is a daring presumption for man to transfer the \nword to himself. Not only does man do this, but he calls his work \"higher criticism.\" Now there \nis a criticism which is lawful, because it judges not God's Word, but man's work as to the \nmanuscripts; this is called Textual Criticism, which is quite a different thing. But this \"higher \ncriticism\" is nothing but human reasoning; it is nothing more than the imagination of man's \nheart\u0160those very thoughts and intentions which the Word itself judges! What confusion! what perversion! and what folly! for the further man's criticism departs from the domain of evidence and enters on the sphere of reason, the \"higher\" he calls it! That is to \nsay, the less like a skilled judge he acts, the higher he exalts his judgment! Poor man! Oh that \nyou would submit yourself to this Word. For it must either judge you now, in this day of grace, \nand give you conviction of sin; or it will be your judge in the last day, when every mouth will be \nstopped, and you will be \"speechless\" and \"without excuse.\" (2) kaphleuw (kapeeleuo), \"to corrupt,\" 2 Corinthians 2:17This is another word which occurs only once, and it is, like all such words, full on instruction. It is derived from kaph, a crib or manger, whence kaptw, to eat quickly (Latin, capio, to take). \nThen comes kaphloV, one who sells provisions, esp. a victualler or vintner, and the verb \nkaphleuw, which means to be a kaphloV, to keep a tavern, to sell victuals and drink (esp. wine). Then, like so many words which, in the course of their history, witness to the fallen nature of man, (see 2) and because all such retailers were addicted to adulteration, the verb came to mean, simply, to adulterate. This cannot be more clearly shown than by referring to Isaiah 1:22, \nwhere the Hebrew, \"Thy silver is become dross, \nThy wine mixed with water\"Is rendered in the Septuagint, \"Thy wine merchants (oi kaphloi) mix the wine with water.\"That is exactly what is meant in 2 Corinthians 2:17, where the Apostle says \"we are not as many \nwhich corrupt the word of God,\" i.e. who adulterate and \"water down\" the Word. The Holy Spirit, by confining the use of this verb solely to the ministration of the Word of God, places the greatest possible emphasis upon the practice of the \"MANY!\" He had just been most \nsolemnly declaring that His ministry of that Word was to some the savour of death unto death (i.e. resulting in their endless death). The \"many\" do not so declare all the counsel of God, but they water it down, and adulterate all such discriminating truth, prophesying smooth things, and seeking to please the people instead of studying to show themselves approved unto God (2 Tim \n2:15). The margin of the AV reads \"deal deceitfully with.\" The RV, while translating the word \"corrupting\" in the text, waters down the whole truth in the margin by giving the alternative \nrendering, \"making merchandise of,\" which, while it is far below the solemnity of the passage, \nexemplifies its truth. (3) dolow (doloo), \"to handle deceitfully,\" 2 Corinthians 4:2This is another word which is used only once, and here again it is in connection with the Word \nof God. Indeed, the three might well be compared\u0160Hebrews 4:12; 2 Corinthians 2:17; and this word dolow in 2 Corinthians 4:2. Like some other words which occur only once, its meaning is from that very cause not so clear or obvious as other words in more general use. We have therefore to search for its meaning. First, all verbs ending in ow are causative, carrying out the \nact which is proper to the noun. Hence douloV (doulos) is a slave, therefore doulow (doulo-o) \nmeans to make a slave of another, to enslave: polemoV (polemos) is war, therefore polemow (polemo-o) means to make war, or to make hostile. Now with regard to this word, the noun doloV (dolos) means any cunning contrivance for catching by deceit. Homer uses it of the robe of Penelope, which she used as a means of deceiving her many suitors, saying, she must finish the making of it before she could make up \nher mind. He uses it also of the net with which Vulcan catches Mars, and of the Trojan horse; and of a mousetrap. Hence, doloV means any trick, or contrivance, or stratagem by which another is deceived. The verb dolow therefore must mean the act of deceiving by a trick, or ensnaring by craft. The Greek writers use it of debasing gold, adulterating wine, of dyeing garments, and of disguising \noneself. In this passage, therefore, it means that the Apostle declares that he has not acted thus with the Word of God. He neither used it as a vintner did his wine, adulterating it or watering it down (2 \nCor 2:17); nor did he use it as a juggler or trickster to catch them with it by wile, craft, cunning, \nor stratagem.* * It may be well to note the many words which have had to be used to meet man's \nfallen nature in his various forms of deception:planaw (plano) is \"to lead astray,\" used of doctrinal error or \nreligious deceit paralogizomai (paralogisomai), \"to deceive by false reasoning\" \napataw (apatao), \"to delude with false statements\" kaphleuw (kapeeleuo), \"to adulterate by admixture\" dolow (doloo), \"to deceive by stratagem\" \nyeudw (pseudo), \"to deceive by lying\" \nbaskainw (baskaino), \"to deceive by witchcraft\" An example may be given of the way in which ignorant rationalists thus deal with the Word of God. One quotes Jeremiah 7:22 to prove that Jehovah \"never gave any directions whatever \nabout burnt offerings and sacrifices,\" omitting the words which define and limit the reference to \n\"the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt.\" This is a specimen of the jugglery which \nabounds on all hands either through ignorance or malice. This \"dealing deceitfully\" with the Word of God is seen most frequently when words are quoted apart from their context, by which, of course, the Bible may be made to prove anything. This is a \nfruitful source of error even with those who love and are seeking after the Truth. A glaring example of this wilful deceit is seen in a wall-text which reads, \"Thou shalt not drink wine,\" thus giving as a Divine command that which is uttered as a threat of Divine judgment. \nSee Micah 6:15. (4) artioV (artios), \"perfect,\" 2 Timothy 3:17This is another word which occurs only once, and again in reference to the Word of God. It is \nrendered \"perfect,\" but it means fitted, and has reference to a special aptitude for any given use. The verb, in the same verse, is formed from this word, with the preposition ex, out, prefixed exartizw (exartizo), and it means fitted out, as a vessel for a voyage, fully equipped, completely furnished. The two words are, therefore, cognate, and should be similarly translated. They are, \nmoreover, for the sake of emphasis, put out of their place, in order to attract our attention; one \nis put at the beginning of the sentence and the other at the end, thus:\u0160\"that equipped may be \nthe man of God, for every good work fully equipped\": or fitted...thoroughly fitted out; or \nfurnished..completely furnished. That is to say, He who has \"learned\" and is \"assured of\" the \nWord of God, having been \"made wise unto salvation,\" and has profited by the continued use of \nthe holy Scripture as inspired by God, is \"a man of God,\" i.e., a prophet, and therefore knows from these Scriptures what he is to say as God's spokesman. One who studies man's books will become a man of men; but he who studies God's book will become \"a man of God.\" Moreover he \nwill be equipped for every emergency, fitted out against every need, ready to meet every \ncontingency; just as a vessel when fitted out for a long voyage has to be provided for calm and \nstorm, ready to help a friend or defeat an enemy, prepared for fire and every accident, so the \nman of God, who truly profits by the study of the Scriptures, is equipped and furnished, \nprepared and ready for every emergency. (5) rhtwV (rheetos), \"expressly,\" 1 Timothy 4:1This word rhtwV (rheetos) is from rhtoV, spoken, or expressed in words. The noun rhetor (rhtwr) was used of one who spoke to the people and advised them; then it is used of a hired orator; and rhetoric was used of the arts he employed. So that it may mean here that the Holy \nSpirit actually pronounced these solemn words of 1 Timothy 4:1 audibly in the Apostle's ears* \nin order to emphasise their awful solemnity and the certainty of their truth. (See the context.) * As on other occasions, Acts 10:19,20, 13:2, etc. (6) baskainw (baskaino), \"to bewitch, Galatians 3:1\"O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that you should not obey the truth.\" The word means to fascinate. Indeed the word fascinate is derived from it, the initial f in the Latin taking the place of the b in the Greek. Among the heathen this fascination was with the eye (Deut 38:54,56; Eccl 14:8). In Galatians 3:1 it is used in a wider sense, and by using it only \nonce, the Holy Spirit emphasises it and points to a danger common to the people of God through \nall time. When they profess that they are \"charmed\" by this teacher, or \"fascinated\" by that speaker, they prove themselves to be indeed \"foolish\" (anohtoV,* without understanding), because they are \"fascinated\" and deprived of the use of their faculties, and are in great danger \nof being deceived and turned away from the truth. * Luke 24:25; Rom 1:14; Gal 3:3; 1 Tim 6:9; Titus 3:3. (7) epiousioV (epiousios), Matthew 6:11This word epi-ousios occurs only once. It is not merely a word that was used only once, but it occurs nowhere else, not even in any other Greek writing, for it was coined by the Lord Jesus Himself. Hence there is no help to be obtained in understanding its meaning but from the Holy Spirit. It is translated \"daily\": \"Give us this day our daily bread,\" Matthew 6:11. \nIt has been variously understood and translated. The RV, in the margin, treats it as an ellipsis, and supplies the word \"day\":\u0160\"Greek, our bread for the coming day.\" But this cannot be \ncorrect, for it is in direct opposition to verse 34, where we are expressly told to \"take no thought \nfor the morrow!\" Besides, \"Give us this day our bread for the coming day,\" is a denial of the great fact that our need is supplied day by day. The truth is that we have no stock of grace supplied for future use; that which we need on any particular day is not supplied by God either \nbefore or after, but on the very day, yea, at the very moment of our need. The RV is right in \nsaying that the Greek means \"coming,\" but it would be still more correct to say \"coming upon,\" thus preserving the force of the preposition epi (epi) upon.* * 'EpiousioV cannot be derived from epi, upon, and eimi, to be, because the \nparticiple would then have been epousa. It must be from epi and eimi, to go or come, \nfor the participle of this is, as here, epiousa, going upon or coming upon. We must expect this peculiar word of the Lord Jesus to have such a fulness in it that no one English word is able to express it. It qualifies the word \"bread.\" It is this bread which is \nepiousios, i.e., coming upon us. It is not the bread which perisheth, but the heavenly bread \nwhich cometh down from heaven (John 6:32,33), even Jesus the living Word of God. For \"man \ndoth not live by bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the LORD \ndoth man live.\" In other words, it is not the bread which cometh up from the earth which we ask \nour Father in this prayer; but it is the bread which cometh down from heaven, even Christ, the \nliving Word, and the Scriptures, the written Word. By these alone, we truly live. (8) skoloy (skolops), \"a thorn,\" 2 Corinthians 12:7is another word which occurs only once, in this place. \"There was given to me a thorn in the flesh,\" or more literally, for the flesh (th sarki). Commentators and expositors exhaust their ingenuity in trying to explain what this \"thorn\" was, while the true explanation is given by the \nSpirit in the words which follow. That we may make no mistake as to what the \"thorn\" was, it is immediately added aggeloV Satana, \"an angel of Satan.\"* That is to say, this \"thorn for the \nflesh\" was \"an angel of Satan,\" allowed to come \"in order that he might buffet me\" (ina me \nkolafizh). The word kolaqizw means to give a blow with the fist.** No \"thorn\" could do this. But this evil angel, sent by Satan, could do so; and was permitted to do so, and to be to the \nApostle what a thorn is to the flesh, in order that he might not be exalted above measure by the \nabundance of the revelations which he had received. * Not \"the messenger of Satan.\" There is no article. But the nominative is placed in apposition, in order to explain the skoloy (thorn). In the Received Text, the word \"Satan\" is also in the nominative, but this would in that case explain the angel\u0160that the angel was Satan himself. L., T., Tr., A., and W. H. read Satana, of Satan.** It occurs elsewhere only in Matthew 26:67; Mark 14:65; 1 Cor 4:11; 1 Peter 2:20. First, we have the word \"thorn,\" then we have the explanation, \"an angel of Satan.\" Why should we seek to go further and explain the explanation already given? Why not rest content with what \nis actually said, instead of seeking to introduce something which is not said? The word and the \nphrase occur only in this passage, to show us the importance of the great lesson which it \nteaches. Thrice the Apostle prayed that \"he might depart.\" Literally, \"in order that he might withdraw or go away from me\" (ina aposth ap emou). But his prayer was refused! Why? Because he asked for what he did not need! The grace of Christ was all-sufficient. It was needful for him to be humbled. To accomplish this the very buffeting of Satan was used to defeat his own designs. \nSatan's design is to lift up the servant of God with pride. Yet, here, the buffetings of the \nmessenger of Satan were over-ruled to defeat his own ends, and Satan was taken in his own \ncraftiness. (9) allotrioepiskopoV (allotrio-episkopos), 1 Peter 4:15Allotrio-episkopos is a word which occurs only here, not being used even by any of the Greek classical writers. It is composed of two words, allotrioV (allotrios), \"belonging to another,\" \nand episkopoV (episkopos), \"an overseer\" (bishop). According to this, it would mean one who takes the supervision of affairs which pertain to others and in no wise to himself. Hence it is \nrendered in AV \"a busybody [RV meddler] in other men's matters.\" But this is evidently weak, \nand it is in fact far short of the facts referred to in the context. The Christians were being \nexhorted in this Epistle with regard to a great persecution, which was even then commencing, \nand in which they were charged with being \"murderers,\" \"thieves,\" \"evil-doers,\" and \"allotrio-\nepiskopoi,\" whatever that may mean. Now it is clear that something more is meant here than a \nmere \"busybody,\" or \"meddler,\" by being classed among such great criminals. The fact is, that \nthese persecutions commenced with popular accusations. The \"Christians\" were regarded with \ngeneral hatred, and the common charges brought against them were murders, incendiarism, \netc., but chief of all they were charged with hatred of the world and hostility to society. The \ntechnical term for this latter crime was odium humani generis,* and it meant that the Christians \nwere bent on relaxing the bonds which held society together, introducing divisions into families, \nsetting children against parents, parents against children, and accomplishing all this by \nunlawful and magical arts. This charge was absolutely necessary to procure their death; for in \nthe Roman Empire the right of inflicting capital punishment belonged only to a few high \nofficials, and death was the punishment of magicians. * Not hatred of human kind; but among the Romans genus hominum meant civilised society. The Roman officials scorned a merely religious charge (see Acts 18:15-17, 19:37, etc.). It seems clear, therefore, that the word allotrioepiskopoV was coined in order to express in Greek the Roman indictment of odium humani generis. So elastic an accusation could be easily proved in times of popular excitement. Christians were charged with breaking up the peace of family life, raising discontent and disobedience amongst slaves. True, they were hostile to the \nvices of Roman society, and doubtless denounced them. Society, then, must destroy these \nChristians in self-defence! This is the teaching involved in this word. It is no mere advice to disregard the taunts or jeers of others. It was a solemn exhortation, that when persecution came they were to suffer, not as murderers or thieves, or as being like our agitators\u0160as the enemies of society\u0160but as Christians. \"Be ready always to give an answer\"* (1 Peter 3:15). \"If ye suffer \nfor righteousness' sake happy are ye, and be not afraid of their terror\" (ibid. 3:14). Do not \nsuffer under those terrible accusations and false charges, but suffer \"as a Christian.\" Be not ashamed of this, but glorify God on this behalf (ibid. 4:12-16). * apologia, apologia, is a strictly legal term for a defence against a formal indictment. Many Christians are today ignorant, and therefore unmindful, of what is meant by this solemn exhortation. As the leaders of the people they are taking the place of those whom we speak of as \n\"agitators\"; and, by preaching what is openly called \"a social gospel\" and \"the gospel of the \npeople,\" are helping forward the enemies of society, and are themselves disturbers of the peace, \nunder the guise of what they call \"Christian socialism.\" Such teachers would find it difficult to \nobey the exhortation to make a good defence against such charges, for in their case the \naccusation would be true and not false. (10) dwdekafulon (dodekaphulon), \"twelve tribes\" (Acts 26:7)This word dodekaphulon is used by St. Paul in Acts 26:7, where, speaking of the hope of \nresurrection, he says, \"Unto which promise our Twelve Tribes, instantly serving God, day and \nnight, hope to come.\" This shows that the idea of the Twelve Tribes being \"lost\" is a popular fallacy. \nIt is true that in the Old Testament prophecies the term \"Judah\" may be used technically of the kingdom of Judah, and the term \"Israel\" of the Ten Tribes; but it does not follow that the current \npopular use of the words is marked by the same exactness. We speak today of all the seed of \nAbraham as \"Jews,\" but we do not by such a use of the word determine the fact that they are \nbelonging only to the tribe of Judah! The popular belief is that at the time of the crucifixion only \nthe tribe of Judah was in the land, and responsible for the death of the Lord Jesus. But it is a fact that, at the time of the separation of the two kingdoms, there were \"children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Judah,\" 2 Chronicles 10:17; and in 2 Chronicles 11:3 we read \nof \"all Israel in Judah.\" Long before the dispersion of the Ten Tribes and the captivity of Judah, \nnumbers from all the tribes joined the kingdom of Judah on account of the idolatry introduced \nby the kings of Israel. In 2 Chronicles 11:13, 16, 17, \"the priests and the Levites that were in all Israel resorted to him [Rehoboam, king of Judah] out of all their coasts...and after them out of all the tribes of Israel \nsuch as set their hearts to seek the LORD God of Israel came to Jerusalem, to sacrifice unto the \nLORD God of their fathers. So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah.\"* * But only for three years did this strength continue. Then they, too, fell into idolatry, and were no longer a strength, but a weakness. In 2 Chronicles 15:9, Asa, king of Judah, moved by the prophet Azariah, made a reformation, \"and he gathered all Judah and Benjamin and the strangers with them out of Ephraim and \nManasseh, and out of Simeon: for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance,* when they saw \nthat the LORD his God was with him.\" * The Hebrew is br&, rhov, and means \"multitude.\" See Gen 16:10, 32:12, Deut 1:10, 28:62; Josh 11:4; Judg 6:5, 7:12, etc. Josephus says (Ant. xi. 5, 7) of the term \"Jews,\" \"that is the name they are called by from the day that they came up from Babylon, which is taken from the tribe of Judah, which came first to these places, and thence both they and the country gained that appellation.\" But the word soon obtained a wider application, and on the return from the captivity in Babylon, what we call \n\"Judah\" was not confined merely to the original tribe, but embraced the old kingdom of Judah \nand Benjamin, together with an \"abundance\" out of all the other tribes of Israel. In the Gospels we read of \"Anna, a prophetess, a daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher\" (Luke 2:36). So that here was one of the Ten Tribes who could trace her genealogy, and \nwas yet living in the land. In giving His instructions to the twelve Apostles, the Lord particularly enjoined them, \"Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not, but go rather to the \nlost sheep of the house of Israel\" (Matt 10:5,6). And of Himself He said, \"I am not sent but unto \nthe lost sheep of the house of Israel\" (Matt 15:24). The fact is that the whole nation was spoken of by the Gentiles as \"Jews,\" and the terms \"Jews\" and \"Israelites\" are not used in the New Testament with the distinction which modern usage has \ngiven to them. It is clear from the Book of Esther that in Persia and elsewhere they were known as and spoken of as \"Jews.\" In Jeremiah 34:9, the term \"Jew\" is co-extensive with the term \"Hebrew.\" In Zechariah 8, too, which carefully distinguishes between \"the house of Judah\" and \"the house of Israel\" (v 13), the term \"Jew\" is clearly used of the whole nation (v 23). We see the same indiscriminate use of the words \"Jew\" and \"Israelite\" in the New Testament. Peter, on the day of Pentecost, addresses them as \"men of Judea\" (Acts 2:14), and in v. 22, as \n\"men of Israel.\" And, again, in Acts 4:8, \"Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye \nrulers of the people and elders of Israel...Be it known unto you and to all the people of Israel.\" Further, in Acts 4:27, we are expressly told that, so far from the Jews, as such, being guilty of the death of Jesus, it was \"all the people of Israel.\" Peter and James addressed their Epistles to the Diaspora,* the \"Dispersion,\" i.e. \"the twelve Tribes scattered abroad.\" * The word occurs only in John 7:35; James 1:1 and 1 Peter 1:1. And, finally, the Holy Spirit, by Paul, speaking of the promise of Resurrection made unto the \nfathers, says (Acts 26:7), \"Unto which promise our Twelve Tribes, instantly serving God, day \nand night, hope to come.\" We thus see that those whom we speak of as \"Jews\" are identical with \nthe \"Twelve Tribes.\" Although neither we nor they may be able to separate and distinguish them now, we shall alike \"marvel\" when the true Joseph, who \"is yet alive,\" shall show that He can do so, when He causes them to sit in order before Him (Gen 43:33). These must suffice as examples of the importance of hapax legomina, or words that occur only once. There are a large number of them, and we append a list (by no means exhaustive for the \nfurther study of those who desire to follow up this interesting branch of Bible study. l     ld (dal), Psa 141:3, \"the door\" l     h(z (zeh-gah), Gen 3:19, \"In the sweat of\" l     Pyzrz (zar-zeeph), Psa 62:6, \"water\" l     Ppx (chah-phaph), Deut 33:12, \"shall cover him\" l     bbx (cha-vav),* Deut 33:3, \"he loved\" * This is the word from which the name of the great modern Jewish Society \n(Nwyc ybbwx), Chovevei Zion, is taken.

WHICH OCCUR ONLY ONCEAll these are of the greatest importance. We have noticed one above \"Angel of Satan.\" There are many others; we give an example or two. pneuma Cristou (pneuma Christou), \"the Spirit of Christ,\" Rom 8:9\"Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of His.\" Both the AV and RV print the \nword spirit with a capital \"S,\" as though it meant the Person of the Holy Spirit; and most \nCommentators so interpret it. But pneuma Cristou is a remarkable expression. First, there is no article, \"the,\" either before \"Spirit\" or \"Christ\"; and, secondly, this combination of the two words occurs no where else.* \nThe expression is stamped therefore with special importance, and no help in understanding it \ncan be gained from its use in other passages. * The apparently similar expression in 1 Peter 1:11 has the article. Pneuma Cristou is, literally, Christ-spirit. It is the \"new creature,\" or \"new creation,\" which is created by the Holy Spirit in all those who are \"in Christ\" (2 Cor 5:17). This new nature is called pneuma (pneuma), or spirit, as opposed to that which is only sarx (sarx), flesh. It is said \nto be \"of God.\" It is called (Rom 8:9) pneuma Qeou (pneuma Theou), Spirit of God, or Divine Spirit. It is spoken of as \"Christ in you\" (Col 1:27). It is \"eternal life.\" It is Christ in us, indeed; \nfor Christ risen and ascended is \"our life,\" and this life, regarded in its abstract nature and origin, is called here (Rom 8:9) pneuma Cristou (pneuma Christou). The context supports this exposition, for the very next verse contains a conclusion flowing from the statement: \"If Christ be in you the body [men, indeed] is dead because of sin; but the spirit is life, because of righteousness\" (Rom 8:10). There must be this pneuma Cristou in us of the Holy Spirit's creation, before He can bear witness with our spirits! Hence this Christ-life in us is the subject \nof this wonderful chapter before the Person of the Holy Spirit is spoken of in the 16th verse. Paul never speaks of being \"born again,\" or being \"converted.\" The pneuma Cristou, the Christ-spirit in us, implies this, and more than this; for being \"born again\" or \"converted\" is necessary, even for the earthly portion of the kingdom, the ta epigeia (ta epigeia) or earthly things of John 3:12. When Christ was upon the earth He was, as He is, the life of men. But now that He has been raised from the dead and exalted to the right-hand of God, He has become our life in this especial manner\u0160Resurrection life. And this life is pneuma Cristou, or Christ formed in us by the creative act of the Holy Ghost, as the hope of glory. Christ is called \"a quickening [or life-\ngiving] Spirit\" (1 Cor 15:46), and he that is thus joined to Christ the Lord is one spirit (1 Cor \n6:17). So that we find in Scripture: 1.  That God is Spirit (John 3:24), pneuma o QeoV; 2.  That Christ is Spirit, pneuma (1 Cor 15:46); 3.  That the Holy Ghost is Spirit, pneuma; and \n4.  That our new nature is also pneuma, for that which is born of Spirit is pneuma (John 3:6) And thus we are told by our God and Father's wondrous grace that we are partakers of the \nDivine Nature (2 Peter 1:4). It is this Divine Nature which, in Romans 8:9, is called pneuma \nCristou.* * The word pneuma occurs nearly 400 times in the New Testament, 150 of which are in the Pauline Epistles. It is a question worthy of serious consideration as to what is the meaning of the various usages of pneuma. With the article it is of course the Holy \nSpirit. But without the article and before Pentecost, what can pneuma agion mean in Luke 11:13, \"How much rather shall My Father give holy and divine spirit to them \nthat ask Him?\" What can it mean in John 20:22? Certainly not the Person of the Holy Spirit, for He was not yet given, because Jesus was not yet glorified (John 7:39). The Church soon became corrupt, and before the Canon of Scripture was complete it had lost the true teaching concerning 1.  The \"Mystery\" (or secret) concerning the Body of Christ, the Church of God; 2.  Justification on the principle of faith alone; and \n3.  The work of the Holy Spirit. At the Reformation, the second of these was partially recovered. Some sixty years ago the first \nwas recovered, but was speedily perverted; while the third has never been fully or properly \nrecovered. Where is the Commentary on the Romans in which \"the spirit of life in Christ Jesus\" \nand the \"spirit of adoption\" (i.e. Sonship spirit) is not confounded with the indwelling of and \nwith the Person of the Holy Ghost? All modern sects and all modern spiritual movements have in each case added some new and distinct form of false teaching concerning the Holy Spirit's work to their special and peculiar \nerrors. Yet the truth of God remains, and the Word is still the Spirit's sword. ennomoV Cristou* (ennomos Christou), \"under the Law to Christ,\" 1 Cor 9:21* The word ennomoV occurs twice (here and Acts 19:39, lawful), but this phrase only once. This is another difficult expression. One thing is certain, viz., that there is no article with either of the two words \"Law\" or \"Christ,\" and that there is nothing about \"the\" Law. The RV omits the \narticle, and renders \"under law to Christ.\" Another thing is certain, viz., that there is no \"to.\" The word Cristou is in the genitive case, and not the dative (according to all the critical texts). Gentile Christians are very anxious to put themselves under \"the Law.\" But God has never put them there. The Law was given by God to Israel by the hand of Moses. Gentile Christians have never thus been put under that Law. Indeed, as a Jew, Paul declares distinctly of himself and his Jewish brethren in Christ, Romans 7:6 (following the AV margin), \"Now we are delivered from the Law, being dead to that wherein we were held\"; or, as in RV, \"having died to that wherein we were held,\" i.e. as Jews they had, in Christ, died to the Law, and on resurrection ground their old husband had no more claim upon them. Then in 1 Corinthians 9:20, 21, he says, \"Unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the Law as under the Law.\" Here there is an important sentence \ndropped out by a later scribe, but it is found in all the ancient versions and critical texts, and it \nis restored in the RV\u0160\"NOT BEING MYSELF UNDER THE LAW!\" Then he goes on to continue his argument: \"to them that are without Law as without Law\" ( being not anomoV \nQeou, but ennomoV Cristou); or, being not an outlaw of God, but a subject-of-the-Law of Christ; or, being not destitute of Divine Law, but under Christ's Law; i.e. though I am not under \nthe Law of Moses, I am under a law of God. How? I am under obedience to the commandments \nof Christ! As much as to say, If I keep Christ's commandments what law shall I break? None! \nFor if I walk in the love of Christ I shall fulfil the Law of Moses (Rom 13:10). If I walk in love I \nshall \"fulfil the Law of Christ\" (Gal 6:2). The conclusion therefore is, that Gentiles who never were under the \"Law,\" and Israelites who were, if they are both \"in Christ,\" are not under the Law of Moses, but are under obedience to \nthe commandments of Christ, which are far higher and far holier. The passage therefore does \nnot prove that Gentiles or Christians are under the Law, but are \"freed from the Law.\" Another phase of this great subject is where   ONLY ONE WORDis employed to denote a certain thing, though that word may be used and occur many times. \nThe Hebrew noun for Truth is a remarkable illustration of this. Many are the words used for deceit and lies, (see above) but there is only one word for truth. God's truth is one! Man's lies \nare almost infinite! The word tme)v (Emeth) means firmness and stability, perpetuity, security. \nThis is what God is. This is exactly what man is not! Man is altogether vanity. \"All men are \nliars\" (Psa 116:11). \"His mouth is full of cursing, deceit [Heb. pl., deceits], and fraud; under his \ntongue is ungodliness and vanity\" (Psa 10:7). \"They speak vanity every one with his neighbour: \nwith flattering lips and a double heart do they speak\" (Psa 12:2). Truth is found only in the Word of God, in Christ, who says of Himself, the living Word, \"I am the truth\" (John 14:6); and of the written Word, the Scriptures, \"Thy word is truth\" (John \n17:17). Truth is heard only in the Word of God. It is taught only by Jesus. Hence it is written (Eph 4:20,21), \"Ye have not so learned Christ, if so be that ye have heard HIM, and have been taught \nby HIM, as the truth is in Jesus.\" These last words are generally misquoted, as though they said, \n\"the truth as it is in Jesus.\" But this is quite a different thing! This implies that there is some \ntruth to be found apart from Jesus! No, it says, \"even as the truth is in Jesus\" (RV), i.e., in Him, \nand no where else. By nature all men are like Jacob. He was a deceiver, and in attempting to \ngain his blessings by deceit, he brought sorrows and troubles upon himself. Those blessings \nwhich God designed for him were, and will be, wrought by the \"God of truth,\" as it is written, \n\"Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob\" (Micah 7:20). The Rabbins have pointed out that man being pure falsehood, God appointed him to death, that with the fear of death before his eyes he might be pious and learn the truth. Hence out of the \nword tm) (Emeth) they made (by the rule of Notricon or Acrostic) three words: ) standing for Nwr) (Aron), \"a coffin\" \nm standing for h+m (Mittah), \"a bier\" \nt standing for Mykyrkt (Tachreecheem), \"shrouds\"Hence they taught that the death of God's saints was \"precious in the sight of the LORD\" (Psa \n116:15), for only in resurrection can he know what he has lost, viz., the image of God, and thus \n\"Truth shall spring out of the earth\" (Psa 85:11). But a more simple fact concerning this remarkable word is this, that the first letter, Aleph ()), is the first letter of the alphabet; the middle letter, Mem (m), is in the middle of the alphabet; while \nthe last letter, Tau (t), is the last letter of the alphabet. As much as to say to us, that the Word of \nthe LORD is altogether truth. From beginning to end every letter and every word expresses, and \ncontains, and is the Truth of God. While Jesus is Himself the Alpha and the Omega,* the first \nand the last, the beginning and the ending of the ways, and works, and words of God (Rev \n1:8,17). * These are the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet. We must distinguish between Emeth, truth, and Emmunah, which means \"faithfulness\";* and \nalso Aman, Nma)af (Ahman), which is from a different root, and as an adverb means truly, \ncertainly, and as an adjective firm or faithful. It is from this that the Latins derived their word \nomen and ominous, because they firmly believed in their omens. How much more should we \nbelieve that to which we put our Amen, when we use this selfsame word. * Hab 2:4. The righteous man believes God, and lives in the firm expectation that \nwhat God has said He will perform. Hence his faith is the proof and evidence that God \nhas justified him, and it is thus counted to him for righteousness. Hab 2:4 is quoted three times in the New Testament, viz., Rom 1:17; Gal 3:11 and Heb 10:38.   Back | Contents | Next  Back | Contents | Next PART II ITS SPIRITUAL SIGNIFICANCE TWOWe now come to the spiritual significance of the number Two. We have seen that One excludes all difference, and denotes that which is sovereign. But Two affirms that there is a \ndifference\u0160there is another; while One affirms that there is not another! This difference may be for good or for evil. A thing may differ from evil, and be good; or it may differ from good, and be evil. Hence, the number Two takes a two-fold colouring, according to \nthe context. It is the first number by which we can divide another, and therefore in all its uses we may trace this fundamental idea of division or difference. The two may be, though different in character, yet one as to testimony and friendship. The Second that comes in may be for help and deliverance. But, alas! where man is concerned, this \nnumber testifies of his fall, for it more often denotes that difference which implies opposition, \nenmity, and oppression.* * Like many other words; e.g., the verb \"prevent\" meant originally for one to get \nbefore another. But because whenever one man got before another it was always to \nthe hindrance and hurt of that other, the word gradually took on the meaning to \nhinder, and thus testifies of man's fall. So with the word simple: it meant originally \nsincere, open, honest. But in man's judgment, any one who so acts is a fool. Hence, \nman soon came to use the word simple as denoting a very foolish person! So in the \nFrench with the word chef, which means \"chief.\" But as man makes \"a god of his belly\" he who can best gratify its lusts has a unique claim to this word. When the earth lay in the chaos which had overwhelmed it (Gen 1:2), its condition was universal ruin and darkness. The second thing recorded in connection with the Creation was the \nintroduction of a second thing\u0160Light; and immediately there was difference and division, for \nGod DIVIDED the light from the darkness. So the second day had division for its great characteristic (Gen 1:6). \"Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it DIVIDE the waters from the waters.\" Here we have Division \nconnected with the second day. This great spiritual significance is maintained throughout the Word of God. Of course we cannot recognise any human arrangements or divisions of books, chapters, or verses, etc. We can take only that division, order, and arrangement which is Divine. The second of any number of things always bears upon it the stamp of difference, and generally of enmity. Take the second statement in the Bible. The first is\u0160 Gen 1:1: \"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.\"The second is, \"And the earth was [or rather became] without form and void.\" Here the first speaks of perfection and of order. The second of ruin and desolation, which came to pass at some time, and in some way, and for some reason which are not revealed.   THE DIVISIONS OF THE BIBLEThen we have seen (pp. 34,35) that the Book of Genesis is Divinely divided into twelve parts (consisting of an Introduction and eleven Tol'doth). The first of these twelve divisions records the perfection of God's sovereign work. The second (Gen 2:4-4:26) contains the account of the \nFall; the entrance of a second being\u0160the Enemy\u0160that old Serpent the Devil, introducing \ndiscord, and sin, and death. \"Enmity\" is seen first in this second division. \"I will put \nenmity\" (Gen 3:15). We see a second to God in the Serpent; a second creature in the woman, \nwho was deceived and \"in the transgression\"; a second man, in the Seed of the woman, the \nsubject of the great primeval promise and prophecy. Hence the number two becomes associated \nwith Incarnation, with the second Person of the ever-blessed Trinity, \"the second Man,\" \"the last \nAdam.\" The second \"Tol'doth\" (Gen 5:1-6:8) begins with the words, \"The book of the generations of Adam.\" While of \"the second Man\" it is written (Matt 1:1) \"the book of the generation of Jesus \nChrist.\" If we look at the Pentateuch as a whole, we see, in the First book, Divine sovereignty (see p. 53), but the Second book (Exodus) opens with \"the oppression of the enemy.\" Here, again, there is \"another,\" even the Deliverer and the Redeemer, who says, \"I am come down to deliver\" (Exo \n3:8). To Him the praise is offered in the Song of Moses: \"Thou in Thy mercy hast led forth the \npeople which Thou hast redeemed\" (Exo 15:13). And thus Redemption is introduced into the \nBible, and mentioned for the first time in this second book, and in connection with the enemy \n(just as was the first promise of the Redeemer in Gen 3:15). The second of the three great divisions of the Old Testament, called Nebiim, or the Prophets (Joshua, Judges, Ruth, 1 and 2 Samuel, 1 and 2 Kings, Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel) contains \nthe record of Israel's enmity to God, and of God's controversy with Israel. In the first book \n(Joshua) we have God's sovereignty in giving the conquest of the land; while in the second \n(Judges) we see the rebellion and enmity in the land, leading to departure from God and the \noppression of the enemy. Here, again, we have side by side with the enemy the \"saviours\" whom God raised up to deliver His people. In the third great division of the Old Testament, called \"the Psalms,\" because it commences with the Book of Psalms, we have in the Hebrew Canon, as the second Book, the Book of Job. Here, \nagain, we see the enemy in all his power and malignity opposing and oppressing a child of God; \nand we are taken within the veil to behold the living God as the shield of His people, a very \npresent help in the needful time of trouble. Besides Genesis, the Book of Psalms is the only book which is marked by any similar Divine divisions. It consists of Five Books: The first - Psalms 1-41 The second - Psalms 42-72 \nThe third - Psalms 73-89 \nThe fourth - Psalms 90-106 \nThe fifth - Psalms 107-150The Second Book of the Psalms commences (as does Exodus) with \"the oppression of the \nenemy\" (Psa 42:9). This is the burden of the whole of this Psalm, and indeed of the whole of this \nsecond Book! Not only is this true of this Second Book, but it is true also of the second Psalm of each of the other books! e.g.:\u0160 The second Psalm of First Book (Psa 2):\u0160\"Why do the heathen rage, And [why] do the people imagine a vain thing? \n[Why do] the kings of the earth set themselves, \nAnd [why do] the rulers take counsel together \nAgainst the LORD and against His anointed?\" But here, again, we have the Deliverer, in verse 6. \"Yet have I set My King.\"The Second Psalm of the Second Book (Psa 43) opens with \"the oppression of the enemy,\" \nrepeated in v. 2, together with the prophecy of praise for the promised Deliverer. The second Psalm of the Third Book (Psa 74):\u0160\"Lift up Thy feet unto the perpetual desolations: Even all that the ENEMY hath done wickedly in the sanctuary, \nThine ENEMIES roar in the midst of Thy congregations... O God, how long shall the ADVERSARY reproach? Shall the ENEMY blaspheme Thy name for ever?... \nRemember this, that the ENEMY hath reproached, O LORD... \nO let not the oppressed return ashamed... \nArise, O God, plead Thine own cause... \nForget not the voice of Thine ENEMIES.\" The second Psalm of the Fourth Book (Psa 91) would have to be quoted as a whole. It describes \nhow the enemy shall be finally trodden down by the coming Deliverer. The second Psalm of the Fifth Book (Psa 108):\u0160\"That Thy beloved may be delivered: Save with Thy right hand, and answer me... \nGive us help from trouble, \nFor vain is the help of man. \nThrough God we shall do valiantly: \nFor He it is that shall tread down our ENEMIES.\" The same significance of the number Two is seen in the New Testament. Wherever there are two \nEpistles, the second has some special reference to the enemy. In 2 Corinthians there is a marked emphasis on the power of the enemy, and the working of Satan (2:11, 11:14, 12:7. See pp. 76,77). In 2 Thessalonians we have a special account of the working of Satan in the revelation of \"the \nman of sin\" and \"the lawless one.\" In 2 Timothy we see the church in its ruin, as in the first epistle we see it in its rule In 2 Peter we have the coming apostacy foretold and described. While In 2 John we have the \"antichrist\" mentioned by this name, and are forbidden to receive into our house any who come with his doctrine.* * Brand (Pop. Ant. iii. 145) quotes Numerus Infaustus, in the preface to which the \nauthor says, \"Such of the kings of England as were the second of any name proved \nvery unfortunate persons, William II, Henry II, Edward II, Richard II, Charles II, James II.\" It is impossible even to name the vast number of things which are introduced to us in pairs, so that the one may teach concerning the other by way of contrast or difference. The two foundations of Matthew 7:24-27: the one which \"fell not, for it was founded upon a rock\"; the other which \"fell, and great was the fall of it.\" The two goats (Lev 16:7); the two \nbirds (Lev 14:4-7); the two opinions (1 Kings 18:21); the two masters (Matt 6:24); the two \ncommandments (Matt 22:40); the two debtors (Luke 7:41); the two covenants (Gal 4:24); the two men (Luke 18:10); the two sons (Matt 21:28, and Luke 15:11, and Gal 4:22), etc., etc.   THE LIFE TYPES OF GENESISThe second of the seven life-types of Genesis has the same character. \nThe first Adam sets forth our first parents in their innocence, fall, and expulsion, driven out from the presence of God (Gen 3:24). How could they again walk with God? This is the great \nproblem which is to be solved in the words which immediately follow, written on the forefront of \nrevelation to set before us the answer to the all-important question, \"How can TWO walk \ntogether except they be agreed?\" (Amos 3:3). The solution is given in Genesis 4, in the second life-type, which is two-fold in the persons of Cain and Abel. Here are presented and described the Two ways\u0160\"The way of God\" (Acts \n18:26) and \"The way of Cain\" (Jude 11), the only two Religions which the world has ever seen. \nOne, the true; the other, the false. True religion is one and unchangeable. Its language is\u0160 \"NOTHING in my hand I bring, Simply to Thy cross I cling.\"False religion is one and unchangeable. It has many varieties; its one language is\u0160 \"SOMETHING in my hand I bring.\"Men quarrel bitterly as to what that something is to be. They persecute, and burn, and destroy \none another in the heat of their controversies about it. But however this \"something\" may vary, \nit is one, in that it is not \"the way of God,\" not the way which God has appointed, but it is \"the \nway of Cain,\" man's way. The one is \"faith,\" the other is \"works.\" The one is \"grace,\" the other \nis human \"merit.\" The one is \"the path of life,\" the other ends in \"the second death.\" Not only have we this contrast or eternal difference in Cain and Abel, but others are presented in this manner, in order to bring out truths of the deepest significance and solemnity.   ABRAHAM AND LOTare so presented. These two were related as uncle and nephew; both descended from Shem through Terah. Both started together from Ur of the Chaldees to Haran in Mesopotamia (Gen \n11); they both started together from Haran to go into the land of Canaan (Gen 12:4); and \nafterwards they both go up together out of Egypt (Gen 13:1). But soon the difference between \nthe two was manifested, and \"there was a strife\" between them. The difference was manifested. Lot, the second of this pair, lifted up his own eyes and chose his own portion (13:11); while Abram's portion was chosen for him by God (13:14). Thus they were \"separated\" (13:11,14). First, Lot looked and \"behold\" the plain of Jordan with its cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, and it seemed to him \"as the garden of the LORD\" (Gen 13:10); then he \"chose\" this for his portion \n(13:11); then he \"pitched his tent towards Sodom\" (13:12); then he \"dwelt in Sodom,\" and \nshared in Sodom's troubles and wars, and lost all the treasure which he had laid up there \n(14:12). He afterwards \"sat in the gate of Sodom\" (19:1) and held office there as a judge in \nspite of his being daily \"vexed\" with their ungodly words and deeds (2 Peter 2:6-9); and finally \nhe escaped from its overthrow, only with his life. Abram, on the other hand, had his portion with God. He walked by faith; he pitched his tent only where he could build his altar (12:8, 13:3,4); he held communion with God who was his \"shield \nand exceeding great reward\" (15:1). Though he was a stranger on earth, he was \"the friend of \nGod,\" and received the secrets of God's purposes (Psa 25:14; Amos 3:7; John 15:15). Truly \nthere was a difference. And this difference was greater in their two wives. Sarah was a type of \nthe Heavenly Jerusalem (Gal 4:21-31); while \"Lot's wife\" became a pillar of salt, and remains a \nbeacon of warning to be for ever remembered (Luke 17:32).   ISAAC AND ISHMAELare presented together. Here the relationship was nearer, for they were step-brothers. Both were the sons of Abram, Sarah being the mother of Isaac, and Hagar the mother of Ishmael. \nThough the relationship according to the flesh was nearer than that between Abram and Lot, the \ndifference was morally and spiritually greater. For it is written, \"neither because they are the \nseed of Abraham are they all children: for in Isaac shall thy seed be called\" (Rom 9:7). Oh! how \ngreat was the difference! Isaac, \"born after the spirit\"; Ishmael, \"born after the flesh\" (Gal \n4:29,30), and therefore a persecutor. We read of no \"just\" Ishmael, no \"righteous\" Ishmael, as \nwe do of Lot. Lot's descendants were the Moabites and Ammonites, and Ruth the Moabitess was \nan ancestress of Jesus. But Ishmael's posterity were \"cast out,\" and continue to this day wild \nand unsubdued.   JACOB AND ESAUare presented together. Here the relationship is still closer. Not only were they the children of the same father (Isaac), but of the same mother (Rebekah). But the spiritual difference is still \ngreater. The enmity was manifested when the babes \"struggled together,\" being yet unborn (Gen \n25:22). And it is written in the Scriptures of truth, \"Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I \nhated\" (Mal 1:2,3; Rom 9:13). Esau was \"a fornicator and a profane person,\" despising his \nbirthright (Heb 12:16,17); while Jacob so loved and prized it that he sinned grievously in \ngrasping it. As the difference is seen in the posterity of Abraham and Lot, Isaac and Ishmael, so \nhere it is still more marked. Israel is Jehovah's glory, the \"everlasting nation\" (Isa 43:12,13, \n44:7); while the Edomites were accursed. And of the Amalekites Jehovah declared that He would \"have war with Amalek from generation to generation\" (Exo 17:16). We see the same significance in the   WORDS WHICH OCCUR TWICEA long list of these might be made. We give a few from the Hebrew and from the Greek. In all such words we can see important instruction. In apoplew (apopleo) we see the work of the enemy seducing the very elect, were it possible (Matt 13:22), and causing them to err from the \nfaith (1 Tim 6:10). In apopnigw (apopnigo) we see the enemy choking the seed (Matt 13:7), and himself choked in the sea (Luke 8:33). In apolausiV (apolausis) we have the things which God has given us for enjoyment (1 Tim 6:17), and the enjoyment of the pleasures of sin (Heb 11:25). In apokuew (apokueo) we have sin bringing forth death (James 1:15), and God begetting us by the word of truth (James 1:18). In atmiV (atmis) we see the difference between earthly life, which is but a vapour, compared with life which is eternal (James 4:14; Acts 2:19). In panoplia (panoplia) (panoply) we see a difference indeed. It is not that the word occurs twice (merely as a word), but it is used in two senses and two places, namely, of the armour of \nSatan (Luke 11:22), and the armour of God (Eph 6:11,17). The armour of the \"strong man\" is taken from him by the \"stronger than he,\" and the soul is delivered, never more to be under the dominion of Satan. All the armour in which Satan trusted \nis then taken away from him (Luke 11:21,22), and the poor sinner who was before in his power \nis now endued with the \"whole armour of God.\"* * Not so when Satan \"goes out\" of a man of his own accord. For this parable is given \nin immediate connection with the other. Satan is not despoiled of his armour in this \ncase. He is not \"cast out.\" Hence the man sweeps his house and garnishes it. He takes \npledges, and wears badges, but the house is \"empty.\" Satan returns with all his power, and the last state of that man is worse than the first (Luke 11:24-26; Matt 12:43-45). Similar studies may be made with other words. And even where a word may occur often, it may occur only twice in connection with another word making a phrase. This may be significant. For example, o uioV thV apwleiaV, the son of perdition. Both of these words, \"son\" and \"perdition,\" occur many times, but only twice together (John 17:12 and 2 Thess 2:3, pointing to \nPsa 109). Some have questioned from this whether Judas Iscariot will be revealed again as the \nman of sin.

James 4:14 l     acreioV (achreios), unprofitable, Matt 25:30; Luke 17:10 l     acuron (achuron), chaff, Matt 3:12; Luke 3:17 Not only do we trace this significance where we have the number \"two,\" but where two things are named, though they are not numbered. For example:\u0160   THE POTTER'S TWO VESSELS OF JEREMIAH 18:1-4The first vessel which he made was marred; the second was \"another\" vessel, as it pleased the potter to make it. This is interpreted in the context, of Israel ruined, but to be restored; broken off, but to be grafted in again; self-destroyed, but finding Divine help. The same great difference may be seen in the TWO COVENANTS. The first marred, not faultless, waxen old, and taken away (Heb 8:7,8,13, 10:9); the second \"a better Covenant,\" \n\"new,\" and \"established\" (Heb 8:6,8, 10:9,16,17). The ORDINANCES of the Law, \"weak\" and \"unprofitable\" (Heb 7:18, 10:6,9). The ordinances of grace, the \"good things to come.\" \"The FIRST MAN,\" marred (Gen 2:7, 3:19), and of the earth, earthy. \"The second man,\" the Lord from Heaven (1 Cor 15:47). The first Adam condemned to death, the last Adam living \nagain for evermore. The BODY, marred in the Fall, and made subject to death and corruption, but in Resurrection to be made like Christ's own body of glory (1 John 3:1-3; Phil 3:21; Rom 8:23; 1 Cor 15:42-49). The OLD CREATION under the curse marred and ruined (Gen 3); \"The New Heavens and the New Earth\" established in righteousness (Rev 21, 22);\u0160a mighty difference indeed. \"No night \nthere,\" \"no need of the sun,\" \"no more sorrow,\" \"no more curse,\" no more sin, or suffering, or \ndeath. Oh, wondrous difference! and this for ever and for ever. \"He taketh away the first that He \nmay ESTABLISH the second.\" \"Praise the LORD!\" Rebellious ISRAEL'S heart taken away, and \na new heart given. ORDINANCES which \"perish with the using\" replaced by the Christ of God. \nMAN ruined and lost, but saved with an everlasting salvation. The BODY of humiliation sown in \ncorruption, but raised in incorruption. The HEAVENS AND EARTH passed away, and the new heavens and the new earth established for ever in glory. But we have seen that where there are two, though there is still difference, this difference may be in a good sense. It may be for oppression or hindrance, or it may be for association and \nmutual help. See Ruth 4:11, where of Leah and Rachel it is written: \"Which two did build up the \nhouse of Israel.\" It may be the proverbial \"Two and two\" of apostleship and service. Or it may \nbe our association with Christ in death and resurrection, of which Baptism and the Lord's \nSupper are the great sign and token. Especially does it mark that \"other,\" the Saviour and mighty deliverer, spoken of in Psa 89:19: \"I have laid help on one that is mighty.\" The second person of the Trinity partook of two \nnatures\u0160 perfect God and perfect man. Perfect man indeed, but oh, how different! \"Two are \nbetter than one, because they have a good reward for their labour. For if they fall, the one will \nlift up his fellow; but woe to him that is alone when he falleth, for he hath not another to help \nhim up.\" It is still \"another,\" but there is \"help\" instead of enmity. No longer the two differing, but the two agreed; for \"How can two walk together except they be agreed?\" (Amos 3:3). Two testimonies may be different, but yet one may support, strengthen, and corroborate the other. Jesus said: \"The testimony of two men is true. I am one that bear witness of myself, and \nthe Father that sent me beareth witness of me\" (John 8:17,18). And it is written in the Law: \"At \nthe mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses,\" shall the matter be established (Num 35:30; \nDeut 17:6, 19:15; Matt 18:16; 2 Cor 13:1; 1 Tim 5:19; Heb 10:28). The whole Law itself hung \non \"two commandments\" (Matt 22:40). God's own revelation is two-fold. The Old Covenant and the New are God's sufficient testimony to man. And yet how different. The Law and Grace; Faith and Works! We may notice also that it is the second Person of the Trinity who is specially called \"the Faithful Witness\" (Rev 1:5). And we have other examples of the number Two in connection with \nfaithful testimony. Caleb and Joshua were two faithful witnesses of the truth of God's Word. \nFaithlessness said: \"We be not able to go up against the people. For they are stronger than we.\" \nBut Faith could say \"Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome \nit\" (Num 13:30,31). And these were the two who alone out of 600,000 men did possess their \ninheritance in the land. Today, also, it is not numbers. The testimony of numbers may be as false \ntoday as was that of the Spies. It is the testimony of the two based on God's Word which alone \nwas true. May this encourage us to stand firm in these days of apostasy, with ears deaf to the \nwords of man, but attentive to the words of Jehovah. Firm, even though the whole congregation \nbe against us, and we be only the few who are waiting to be caught up to meet the Lord in the \nair. Let us have for our seal the faithfulness of Jehovah, and say always and ever, \"Let God be true, and every man a liar.\" It is remarkable that words having special reference to Testimony, should occur twice; for example:\u0160 l     alhqeuw (aleetheuo), to tell the truth, Gal 4:16; to speak the truth, Eph 4:15 l     ametaqetoV (ametathetos), immutable, Heb 6:18; immutability, Heb 6:17 l     anakefalaioomai (anakephalaioomai), comprehend, Rom 13:9; gather together in one, Eph 1:10 l     bebaiwsiV (bebaiosis), confirmation, Phil 1:7; Heb 6:16 l     keraia (keraia), tittle, Matt 5:18; Luke 16:17 l     nomoqetew (nomotheteo), received the law, Heb 7:11; was established, Heb 8:6 l     ametamelhtoV (ametameleetos), without repentance, Rom 11:29; not to be repented of, \n2 Cor 7:10 l     eggrafw (engrapho), written in, 2 Cor 3:2,3 l     dikaiwsiV* (dikaiosis), justification, Rom 4:25, 5:18 * See under the number Nine.   Back | Contents | Next  Back | Contents | Next PART II ITS SPIRITUAL SIGNIFICANCE THREEIn this number we have quite a new set of phenomena. We come to the first geometrical figure. Two straight lines cannot possibly enclose any space, or form a plane figure; neither can two \nplan surfaces form a solid. Three lines are necessary to form a plan figure; and three \ndimensions of length, breadth, and height, are necessary to form a solid. Hence three is the \nsymbol of the cube--the simplest form of solid figure. As two is the symbol of the square, or plane contents (x2), so three is the symbol of the cube, or solid contents (x3). Three, therefore, stands for that which is solid, real, substantial, complete, and entire. All things that are specially complete are stamped with this number three. God's attributes are three: omniscience, omnipresence, and omnipotence. \nThere are three great divisions completing time--past, present, and future. Three persons, in grammar, express and include all the relationships of mankind. Thought, word, and deed, complete the sum of human capability. \nThree degrees of comparison complete our knowledge of qualities. The simplest proposition requires three things to complete it; viz., the subject, the predicate, and the copula. Three propositions are necessary to complete the simplest form of argument--the major premiss, the minor, and the conclusion. Three kingdoms embrace our ideas of matter--mineral, vegetable, and animal. When we turn to the Scriptures, this completion becomes Divine, and marks Divine completeness or perfection. Three is the first of four perfect numbers (see p. 23). l     Three denotes divine perfection; l     Seven denotes spiritual perfection; l     Ten denotes ordinal perfection; and l     Twelve denotes governmental perfection. Hence the number three points us to what is real, essential, perfect, substantial, complete, and Divine. There is nothing real in man or of man. Everything \"under the sun\" and apart from God \nis \"vanity.\" \"Every man at his best estate is altogether vanity\" (Psa 139:5,11, 62:9, 144:4; Eccl \n1:2,4, 2:11,17,26, 3:19, 4:4, 11:8, 12:8; Rom 8:20). Three is the number associated with the Godhead, for there are \"three persons in one God.\" Three times the Seraphim cry, \"Holy, Holy, Holy\"--one for each of the three persons in the \nTrinity (Isa 6:3). The living creatures also in Revelation 4:8. Three times is the blessing given in Numbers 6:23, 24:-- l     \"The LORD bless thee and keep thee (the Father); l     The LORD make His face shine upon thee; and be gracious unto thee (the Son); l     The LORD lift up His countenance upon thee, and give thee peace\" (the Holy Spirit). Each of these three blessings is two-fold, so that there are two members in each, while the name Jehovah occurs three times. This marks the blessing as Divine in its source. No merit drew it \nforth; grace was its origin and peace was its result. In Genesis 18:2, the same three persons appear to Abraham. Abraham \"looked, and, lo, THREE men stood by him.\" But verse 1 declares that it was \"Jehovah appeared unto him.\" It is \nremarkable that Abraham addresses them both as one and as three. We read first that \"they \nsaid,\" then \"he said,\" and finally, in verses 13 and 17, 20, etc., \"And the LORD said.\" The whole \nnarrative, which begins with the appearance of the LORD, ends (v 33), \"And the LORD went \nHis way.\" As we have in the number one the sovereignty of the one God; and in two the second person, the Son, the great Deliverer; so in \"three\" we have the third person, the Holy Spirit, marking and \ncompleting \"the fulness of the Godhead.\" This word \"fulness\" is remarkable, occurring only \nthree times, and in connection with the Three Persons of the Trinity: l     Ephesians 3:19, \"The fulness of God.l     Ephesians 4:13, \"The fulness of Christ.\" l     Colossians 2:9, \"The fulness of the Godhead.\" The \"fulness\" was manifested visibly in Christ, and is communicated by the Holy Spirit, for it is \na fulness of which we receive by His mighty power (John 1:16). This is why Abraham brought \"three measures of meal\" for his heavenly guest. This is why \"three measures of meal\" formed the great meal offering; because it set forth the perfection of \nChrist's perfect and Divine nature. In Leviticus no particular quantity of meal was prescribed, \nbut in Numbers 15:9, we read, \"Then shall he bring with the bullock a meal offering of THREE tenth deals of flour.\" This was the measure for the whole burnt offering, and also for great special occasions such as the New Moon and the New Year, etc. It was also the special measure \nfor the cleansing of the leper (Lev 14:10). The poor leper had several gracious blessings beyond \nothers. He alone was favoured with the anointing which was given only to the Prophet, Priest, \nand King! He alone had the priestly consecration. It is sinners who are now singled out from the \nmass of those who are lost, and dead in trespasses and sins, to be anointed with the Spirit, and \nmade, in Christ, kings and priests unto God. But there is more in these \"three measures of meal.\" We have them in the parable (Matt 13:33), pointing to Christ in all the perfection of His person and His work, when He said, \"Lo, I come to \ndo Thy will, O God.\" There are different opinions about the \"leaven,\" but what is the \"meal.\" \nThis is the point on which the interpretation turns. According to the popular interpretation, this \npure \"meal\" is the corrupt mass of mankind, and the defiling \"leaven\" is the pure Gospel of \nChrist! Was there ever such an exhibition of man's perversity in calling sweet bitter, and bitter \nsweet? Was there ever such a proof that man's thoughts are contrary to God's? No! the \"three \nmeasures of meal\" point us to the perfections of Christ and the purity of His Gospel. And the \nhidden \"leaven\" points us to man's corruption of the Truth. A corruption for which we have to \nlook, not after the third century, but in the first! No leaven could be put into any sacrifice or offering made by fire to the LORD, because in Christ was no sin; therefore, there was to be no leaven. He was, in Himself, \"a sweet savour to \nJehovah.\" True, in one offering there was leaven. But mark the difference and the lesson. In Leviticus 23 we have a list of the Feasts:-- l     1st. The Passover (v 5), on the 14th day. l     2nd. The wave-sheaf of first-fruits on the morrow after the Sabbath (v 11), which might \nbe burnt on the altar as a sweet savour (Lev 2:14-16), because unleavened. l     3rd. Then (50 days after) the oblation of the first-fruits at Pentecost (vv 15-17). This \nmight not be burnt on the altar (Lev 2:12), because it was mixed with leaven! In the antitype of this we see Christ:-- l     1st. Christ our Passover sacrificed for us. l     2nd. As the wave-sheaf of first-fruits, He was raised from the dead and became the first-\nfruits of them that slept (1 Cor 15:20), for in Him there was no sin (and hence no \nleaven). l     3rd. Then, after fifty days, on the Feast of Pentecost came the oblation of the first-fruits \nin the descent of the Holy Ghost; for \"we are a kind of first-fruits of His \ncreatures\" (James 1:18). But His people are not without sin, therefore this oblation had \nleaven mixed with it. It could not be offered to the LORD as a \"sweet savour\" (Lev \n2:12). It was accepted only because a sin-offering was offered with it (Lev 23:18,19), \nand the Priest waved all together for a wave-offering before the LORD. This proves that the \"leaven\" is a type of error, evil, and sin. While the \"three measures of meal\" \nwith which it was mixed and hidden typified the truth and purity of Christ and His Truth, and \nnot the corrupt mass of mankind amongst whom it was introduced. The popular interpretation reverses the types of the meal and the leaven, and makes the leaven that which is good, and the meal that which is evil. But the great Teacher made no such mistake. \"Church doctrine\" is not \n\"Bible truth,\" but it is leavened meal. The number three, therefore, must be taken as the number of Divine fulness. It signifies and represents the Holy Spirit as taking of the things of Christ and making them real and solid in \nour experience. It is only by the Spirit that we realise spiritual things. Without Him and His \ngracious operation, all is surface work: all is what a plane figure is to a solid (John 3:6). He it \nis who has wrought all our works in us, and by whom alone we can serve or worship (John \n4:24). Hence it is that the Holy of Holies, which was the central and highest place of worship, was a cube. Hence it is that the third Book in the Bible is Leviticus, the book in which we learn what true worship is. Here we see Jehovah calling His people near unto Himself, prescribing every detail \nof their worship, leaving nothing to their imagination or their taste, crowning all with the \n\"MUST\" of the great rubric of John 4:24. In true worship we see the FATHER seeking these \ntrue worshippers (John 4:23); the SON, the one object of all worship; and the Spirit qualifying \nand enduing the worshippers with the only power in which they can worship. Thus in Genesis \nwe have sovereignty in giving life--the Father, the beginning of all things; in Exodus we have \nthe oppressor and the Deliverer--the Son redeeming His people; while in Leviticus we have the \nSpirit prescribing, and ordering, and empowering them for Divine worship.   THE FIRST OCCURRENCEof the number is in Genesis 1:13. \"The third day\" was the day on which the earth was caused to rise up out of the water, symbolical of that resurrection life which we have in Christ, and in \nwhich alone we can worship, or serve, or do any \"good works.\" Hence three is a number of RESURRECTION, for it was on the third day that Jesus rose again from the dead. This was Divine in operation, and Divine in its prophetic foreshowing in the \nperson of Jonah (Matt 12:39,40; Luke 11:29; Jonah 1:17). It was the third day on which Jesus \nwas \"perfected\" (Luke 13:32). It was at the third hour He was crucified; and it was for three \nhours (from the 6th to the 9th) that darkness shrouded the Divine Sufferer and Redeemer. The \n\"loud voice\" at the end of those twice three hours, when, \"about the ninth hour,\" He cried, \"My \nGod, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me\" (Matt 27:46), shows completely that nothing of \nnature, nothing of the light or intelligence of this world, could give help in that hour of \ndarkness. Does not this show us our impotence in the matter? Does it not prove our incapacity \nto aid in delivering ourselves from our natural condition? With the light at the ninth hour came the Divine declaration, \"It is finished.\" So divinely finished, completed, and perfected, that now there is no such darkness for those who have died \nwith Christ. Light, uninterrupted light, shines upon all who are risen with Him; uninterrupted \nsunshine--even \"the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.\" That three hours' darkness, \ntherefore, testifies to our complete ruin, and our complete salvation, and shows that His people are \"complete in Him.\" While we are speaking of the Divine perfections of Christ, let us note the many marks and seals of this completeness. \"The Spirit, the water, and the blood,\" are the divinely perfect witness to the grace of God on earth (1 John 5:7). The three years of His seeking fruit testifies to the completeness of Israel's failure (Luke 13:7). \nHis three-fold \"it is written\" shows that the Word of God is the perfection of all ministry (Matt 4). The Divine testimony concerning Him was complete in the threefold voice from Heaven (Matt 3:17, 17:5; John 12:28). He raised three persons from the dead. \nThe inscriptions on the Cross in three languages show the completeness of His rejection by Man. The perfection of His offices are shown in His being Prophet, Priest, and King, raised up from among His brethren (Deut 177:15, 18:3-5, and 18:15). The Divine completeness of the Shepherd's care (John 6:39), is seen in His revelations as-- l     The \"Good Shepherd\" in death, John 10:14. l     The \"Great Shepherd\" in resurrection, Hebrews 13:20. l     The \"Chief Shepherd\" in glory, 1 Peter 4:5. His three appearings in Hebrews 9 show that His work will not be divinely perfect and complete until He appears again. 1.  He \"hath appeared\" in the end of the age to \"put away sin,\" and to \"bear the sins of many\" (Hebrews 9:26,28). 2.  \"Now to appear in the presence of God for us,\" He has ascended into Heaven (v 24). \n3.  He \"shall appear\" again part from all question of sin for those who look for Him (v 28).   ABRAHAM'S COVENANTTo go back to the Old Testament history we have God's Covenant with Abraham stamped with \nthis number of Divine perfection (Gen 15). It was (like David's, 2 Samuel 7) Divinely \"ordered \nin all things, and sure.\" God was ONE, i.e., the one party to it; for Abraham, who would \nwillingly have been the other party, was put to sleep, that the Covenant might be unconditional, and \"sure to all his seed.\" The Divine seal is seen in the choice of three animals, each of three years old (the heifer, the she-goat, and the ram). These, together with the two birds (the dove \nand the pigeon), made five in all, marking it all as a perfect act of free-grace on the part of a \nsovereign God.   THE COMPLETE SEPARATION OF ISRAELis shown in \"the three days' journey into the wilderness\" (Exo 5:3), marking the complete separation with which God would separate His people from Egypt then, and from the world \nnow. We can understand Pharaoh's objection in first wishing them to hold their feast \"in the \nland\" (Exo 8:25), and when that could not be, at last consenting to their going, but adding, \n\"only ye shall not go very far away.\" So Satan now, is well content that we should worship \"in \nthe land\"; and if we must go into the wilderness, that we should be within easy reach of the \nworld and its influences. Not so Jehovah. He will have no such borderland service; He will have \na \"scientific frontier,\" a divinely perfect \"three days' journey into the wilderness,\" completely \nseparating them from all their old associations. The difficulty of \"drawing the line,\" which so \nmany Christians experience, arises from the fact that it is a crooked line, and that it is an \nattempt to include that which cannot be included. Drawn at a proper distance it can be ruled \nstraight, and be divinely perfect and effectual.   THE SPIESbrought three things which testified to the divinely perfect goodness of the land; and the substantial realities proved the truth of Jehovah's word: \"Grapes, figs, and \npomegranates\" (Num 13:23).   AT THE GIVING OF THE LAWthree times Israel said, \"All that the LORD hath spoken we will do\" (Exo 19:8, 24:3,7), marking the completeness of the Covenant-making on the part of Israel; but from that very reason \nforeshadowing its perfect breach, for man has never yet kept any Covenant which he made with \nGod.   AHIMAN, SHESHAI, AND TALMAI,were the three children of Anak, marking the completeness of the giant power of the enemy (Num 13:22).   JORDANwas three times divided, the perfection of the Divine miracle (Josh 4; 2 Kings 2:8,14).   THE THREE DAYS' SEARCHfor Elijah was conclusive testimony that he could not be found (2 Kings 2:17). \n  THE TEMPLEis marked by three, as the Tabernacle is by five. The Holy of Holies in each was a cube; in the Tabernacle a cube of ten cubits; in the Temple a cube of twenty cubits. Each consisted of three \nparts:--The Court, the Holy Place, and the Sanctuary. The Temple had three chambers round \nabout. The Brazen Sea or Laver held three thousand baths; and was compassed by a line of \nthirty cubits on which were 300 knops (1 Kings 7:24). It was supported by twelve oxen (3x4); \nthree looking north, three looking west, three looking south, and three looking east. This order \nin naming the points of the compass occurs nowhere else. It is the same in both accounts of \nKings and Chronicles (see 1 Kings 7:25; 2 Chron 4:4,5). Why is this? Is it because this was the \norder in which the Gospel was to be afterwards preached throughout the world? Whether this \nwas the reason or not, the fact remains that the Gospel was preached first in the north (Samaria, \nDamascus, Antioch); then in the west (Caesarea, Joppa, Cyprus, Corinth, Rome); then in the \nsouth (Alexandria and Egypt); then in the east (Mesopotamia, Babylon, Persia, India).   THE GREAT FEASTSwere three; Unleavened Bread, Weeks, Tabernacles (Deut 16:16). \n  THE SHEETlet down three times to Peter was the fulness of the testimony as to the admission of the Gentiles into the Church (Acts 10:16).   THE OLD TESTAMENTTestimony was complete and perfect in its three-fold division--Law, Prophets, and Psalms (Luke 24:44). The same three divisions mark its character to the present day.   \"TWO OR THREE\"As three marks completeness and perfection of testimony, so it marks the number of spiritual worshippers; and intimates that true spiritual worshippers would always be few.   COMPLETENESS OF PEOPLEl     Shem, Ham, and Japheth. l     Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. l     Gershom, Kohath, and Merari. l     Saul, David, and Solomon. l     Noah, Daniel, and Job. l     Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. l     Peter, James, and John, etc.  COMPLETENESS OF APOSTASY (Jude 11)l     \"The way of Cain.\" l     \"The error of Balaam.\" l     \"The gainsaying of Korah.\"  COMPLETENESS OF DIVINE JUDGMENT (Daniel 6:25-28).l     MENE. God hath NUMBERED thy kingdom and finished it. l     TEKEL. Thou art WEIGHED in the balances and found wanting. l     PERES. Thy kingdom is DIVIDED and given to the Medes and Persians.  THE THREE GIFTS OF GRACE:Faith, Hope, and Love, five times repeated. \n  THE THREE-FOLD NATURE OF MAN:Spirit, and Soul, and Body, the man consisting of neither separately, but of the whole three together.   THE THREE-FOLD NATURE OF TEMPTATION (1 John 2:16)l     \"The lust of the flesh.\" l     \"The lust of the eyes.\" l     \"The pride of life.\" These seen in our first parents when Eve saw (Gen 3:6) that the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil was-- l     \"Good for food,\" l     \"Pleasant to the eyes,\" l     \"To be desired to make one wise.\"  THE THREE-FOLD CORRUPTION OF GOD'S WORDBy taking from, adding to, and altering. This led up to the first sin. 1.  God had said, \"of every tree in the garden thou mayest FREELY eat\" (Gen 2:16). In repeating this, Eve omitted the word \"freely\" (3:2), making God less bountiful than He was. 2.  God had said, \"But of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, thou shalt not eat of it\" (Gen 2:17). In repeating this Eve added the words, \"NEITHER SHALL YE TOUCH \nIT\" (3:3), making God more severe than He was. 3.  God had said, \"Thou shalt SURELY die\" (Gen 3:17, tw@mt@af tw$m). In repeating this Eve altered it to Nw@tmut@:-Np@e \"LEST ye die\" (3:3), thus weakening the \ncertainty of the Divine threat into a contingency. No wonder that dealing thus with the Word of God she listened to the words of the Devil, and \nbecame an easy prey to his guile with which he deceived her. No wonder also that \"the second man,\" \"the last Adam,\" when He was tempted by the same tempter, three times repeated the words \"It is written\"! as though to call attention to the \noccasion of the Fall in the three-fold perversions of God's words. \"It is written,\" and I will not \nomit anything from it; \"It is written,\" and I will not add anything to it; \"It is written,\" and I will not alter it. It is worthy of note that both the temptations began in precisely the same way, by the Tempter questioning the truth of Jehovah's Word. In the former saying, \"Hath God said?\" In the \nlatter saying \"If Thou be the Son of God\" (Matt 4:3), when the voice from Heaven had only just \ndeclared, \"This IS My beloved Son\" (Matt 3:17).   MAN'S THREE GREAT ENEMIESare \"the World, the Flesh, and the Devil\": 1.  The World is set over against the Father (1 John 2:15,16). 2.  The Flesh is set over against the Spirit (Gal 5:17). \n3.  The Devil is set over against the son (the Living Word, Matthew 4:1, etc, and 1 John 3:8; and the Written Word, John 8:44).  \"ASK OF ME\"To three people did God give this command: l     To Solomon (1 Kings 3:5). l     To Ahaz (Isa 7:11). l     And to the Messiah (Psa 2:9).  THE THREE PRAYERS OF MARK Vform a divinely perfect lesson as to prayer and its answer. 1.  Prayer was made by the Legion of Devils, who \"BESOUGHT Him, saying, Send us into the herd of swine...and forthwith Jesus gave them leave\" (vv 12,13). 2.  Prayer was made by the Gadarenes, who \"began to PRAY Him to depart out of their coasts\" (v 17). Jesus granted their request, and departed at once (v 18). 3.  Prayer was made by the man who had just been the recipient of marvellous grace and healing, who \"PRAYED Him that he might be with Him. Howbeit Jesus suffered him \nnot\" (vv 18,19). From this we learn the perfect lesson with regard to prayer, that \"No\" is an answer as well as \n\"Yes\"; and \"No\" is answered always with the same omnipotent grace, infinite wisdom, and \nperfect love as \"Yes.\" We hear much about \"definiteness in prayer.\" Surely the knowledge of \none's intense ignorance as to what is best and wise for us, will make us say more definitely than \never, in the words of Him through whose merits alone prayer is heard at all, \"Thy will be done.\"   THREE THINGS PREDICATED OF GOD (in John's Gospel and Epistles)l     \"God is love\" (1 John 4:8,16). We are therefore to \"Walk in love\" (Eph 5:2). l     \"God is spirit\" (John 4:24, RV, margin). We are exhorted to \"Walk in the spirit\" (Gal 5:16). l     \"God is light\"* (1 John 1:5). We are to \"Walk in the light\" (Eph 5:8). * Light, like God, is three-fold. It has three great rays:\u0160 l     The Heat ray (red), which is felt, not seen, witnesses of the Father, \"whom no \nman hath seen at any time\" (John 1:18; 1 John 4:12). l     The Light ray (yellow), which is seen, not felt, witnesses of Jesus, who hath \n\"declared the Father\" (John 1:18, 12:45, 14:9; Col 1:15; Heb 1:3). l     The Actinic or chemical ray (blue), which is neither seen nor felt, but whose \npresence is revealed by its effects in a chemical action, which produces \nchanges, as in Photography. This witnesses of the Holy Spirit, who is known \nby His wondrous operations (John 3:8). There are a multitude of Threes or Triads, and they all bespeak the same Divine perfection and \ncompleteness wherever they are found.   REVELATION 1The first or introductory section of the Apocalypse of Jesus Christ is specially marked by this great Divine seal stamped upon it in chapter 1. l     v. 1. This Revelation is-- \nDivinely given, \nDivinely sent, \nDivinely signified. l     v. 2. John bare record of-- \nThe Divine \"Word of God.\" \nThe Divine witness (\"the Testimony of Jesus Christ\"). \nThe Divine vision (\"all things that he saw\"). l     v. 3. The Divine blessing on-- \nThe reader, \nThe hearer, and \nThe keeper of this record. l     vv. 4 and 8. The Divine Being-- \nWhich was, \nAnd which is, \nAnd which is to come. l     v. 5. The Coming Lord is presented as-- The Divine Prophet (\"the faithful witness\"). The Divine Priest (\"the first-begotten from the dead\"). \nThe Divine King (\"the Prince of the kings of the earth\"). l     vv. 5, 6. His people are Divinely-- \nLoved, \nCleansed, and \nCrowned. l     vv. 17, 18. Christ is presented as-- \n\"The first and the last\" (Divinely eternal). \nThe dead and living One (Divinely living). \nThe omnipotent One (Divinely powerful). l     v. 19. The Divine Revelation-- \nThe things which thou hast seen, \nWhich are, and \nWhich shall be after these things.   WORDS THAT OCCUR THREE TIMESrefer also in various ways to some Divinely perfect matter. We append a few examples, which \nmay be studied in order to search out the lessons:-- l     rd) (ah-dar), glorious, Exodus 15:6,11; Isaiah 42:21. l     ysp) (aph-see), beside me, Isaiah 47:8,10; Zephaniah 2:15. l     hlwmg (g'moo-lah), recompense, 2 Samuel 19:36; Isaiah 59:18; Jeremiah 51:56. l     hkn (nah-cheh), lame, 2 Samuel 4:4, 9:3; contrite, Isaiah 56:2. l     qyt( (at-teek), ancient, Daniel 7:9,13,22. l     tw)pr (r'phoo-oth), medicines, Jeremiah 30:13, 46:11; Ezekiel 30:21. l     abba (abba), Father, Mark 14:36; Romans 8:15; Galatians 4:6. l     aireomai (haireomai), to choose, Philippians 1:22; 2 Thessalonians 2:13; Hebrews \n11:25. l     apokrufoV (apokruphos), hid, Luke 8:17; Colossians 2:3; kept secret, Mark 4:22. l     apofqeggomai (apophthengomai), speak forth, Acts 26:25; utterance, Acts 2:4; say, \nActs 2:14. l     aceiropoihtoV (acheiropoieetos), made without hands, Mark 14:58; 2 Corinthians \n5:1; Colossians 2:11. l     euwdia (euodia), sweet savour, 2 Corinthians 2:15; Ephesians 5:2; Philippians 4:18. l     kateuqunw (kateuthuno), guide or direct, Luke 1:70; 1 Thessalonians 3:11; 2 \nThessalonians 3:5. l     morfh (morphee), form, Mark 16:12; Philippians 2:6,7.   PHRASES THAT OCCUR THREE TIMESare also similarly significant. \"Before the foundation of the world\" (pro katabolhV kosmou). l     John 17:24. \"Thou lovedst Me before,\" etc. l     Ephesians 1:4. \"Chosen us in Him before,\" etc. l     1 Peter 1:20. \"The blood of Christ foreordained before,\" etc. (when it speaks of this blood as \"shed\" it is apo from the foundation, etc.). The phrase occurs three times, because it is the act of Deity, and flows from uninfluenced grace. When, however, such acts relate to His work in us rather than for us, the words, even in a similar connection, occur seven times, because seven is the number of spiritual perfection. Hence the phrase, \"From [apo] the foundation of the world\" occurs seven times. See under \"seven.\" \"Walk worthy\" (peripatein axiwV, peripatein axios), walk worthilyThis occurs three times, as the Divine and perfect claim on our walk. \"Walk worthily\"l     Of our vocation (Eph 4:1), l     Of the Lord (Col 1:10), l     Of God (1 Thess 2:12).   THE THREE-FOLD COMBINATIONS OF A NUMBERdenotes the essence of such number, the concentration of the significance of the number thus \nexpressed. l     444 is the gematria or number of the word \"DAMASCUS,\" which is the oldest city in \nthe world; four being the world number. l     666 is the number of man, and it symbolises fitly, therefore, the essence of human \nwisdom, and also of imperfection. l     888 is the number or gematria of the name \"JESUS.\" l     999 is the number connected with judgment, hence the numerical value of the phrase th orgh mou (tee orgee mou), my wrath, is 999. The same number is very prominent in the judgment on Sodom. (See further under Nine.)   THE TALMUDhas many references, among other numbers, to the number three. The Rabbis say that there were Three things Moses asked of God1.  That the Schechinah might rest on Israel. 2.  That it might rest on none but Israel. \n3.  That God's ways might be known to him. (Beracheth, fol. 7, col. 1). Three precious gifts were given to Israel1.  The Law. \n2.  The Land. \n3.  The World to come (i.e., the Heavenly Calling). Three menhanded down the ancient wisdom and Divine secrets, viz., Adam, Seth, and Enoch. Whatever may be thought of these, there can be no doubt that in the invariable employment of \nthe number three in the Word of God, we have that which signifies Divine perfection.   ADDITIONAL MISCELLANEOUS ILLUSTRATIONSThree multitudes miraculously fed:\u0160(1) 2 Kings 4:42, 43; (2) Matt 15:34, 38; (3) Mark 6:38, 44. Three times Abraham called the \"Friend of God\":\u0160(1) 2 Chron 20:7; (2) Isa 41:8; (3) James 2:23. Three times the word \"Christian\" is found in the New Testament:\u0160(1) Acts 11:26; (2) Acts 25:28; (3) 1 Peter 4:6.   Back | Contents | Next  Back | Contents | Next PART II ITS SPIRITUAL SIGNIFICANCE FOURWe have seen that three signifies Divine perfection, with special reference to the Trinity: The Father, one in sovereignty; the Son, the second person, in incarnation and salvation, delivering \nfrom every enemy; the Holy Spirit, the third person, realising in us and to us Divine things. Now the number four is made up of three and one (3+1=4), and it denotes, therefore, and marks that which follows the revelation of God in the Trinity, namely, His creative works. He is known \nby the things that are seen. Hence the written revelation commences with the words, \"In-the-\nbeginning God CREATED.\" Creation is therefore the next thing\u0160the fourth thing, and the \nnumber four always has reference to all that is created. It is emphatically the number of \nCreation; of man in his relation to the world as created; while six is the number of man in his \nopposition to and independence of God. It is the number of things that have a beginning, of \nthings that are made, of material things, and matter itself. It is the number of material \ncompleteness. Hence it is the world number, and especially the \"city\" number. The fourth day saw the material creation finished (for on the fifth and sixth days it was only the furnishing and peopling of the earth with living creatures). The sun, moon, and stars completed \nthe work, and they were to give light upon the earth which had been created, and to rule over the \nday and over the night (Gen 1:14-19). Four is the number of the great elements\u0160earth, air, fire, and water. Four are the regions of the earth\u0160north, south, east, and west. \nFour are the divisions of the day\u0160morning, noon, evening, and midnight. Or in our Lord's words, when He speaks of His coming at evening, midnight, cock-crowing, or in the morning \n(Mark 13:35). We are never to put off His coming in our minds beyond tomorrow morning. Four are the seasons of the year\u0160spring, summer, autumn, and winter. Four are the great variations of the lunar phases. \nIn Genesis 2:10, 11, the one river of Paradise was parted, and became into four heads, and \"the fourth river is Euphrates.\" Here, as so often elsewhere, the four is made up of 3 + 1. For three of \nthese rivers are now unnamed, while one is still known by its original name \"Euphrates.\" Four marks division also. For the river was \"parted.\" It is the first number which is not a \"prime,\" the first which can be divided. It is the first square number also, and therefore it marks \na kind of completeness as well, which we have called material completeness. In the next chapter (Gen 3:22-24) the cherubim are first mentioned. These are four, and they have to do with creation always. They are first seen here, keeping, i.e., guarding (Gen 2:15), the \nTree of Life, and thus preserving the blessed hope of immortality for creation. They are next \nseen in connection with atonement, showing the only ground on which creation could hope for \nthe end of its groaning. They are seen on the veil and on the mercy-seat, binding up the hope of \ncreation with Him who is called \"the Hope of Israel.\" So that there is no hope for a groaning \ncreation apart from atonement, apart from Christ, or apart from Israel. In the Apocalypse the same four cherubim are called Swa, \"the living creatures\" (Rev 4). These announce the Coming One; these sing of creation and of Him who created all things, and for whose pleasure they were \ncreated (Rev 4:11). Whenever they speak it is in connection with the earth. These call forth and \nannounce the judgments or plagues (Rev 6) which issue on the ejection of the Usurper from the \nearth, and the destruction of them which destroy the earth, and in the exaltation and \nenthronement of Him when all the kingdoms of the world become the kingdom of our Lord and \nHis anointed, and when the LORD God omnipotent reigneth. Hence it was that these four cherubic forms were placed in the Signs of the Zodiac, and so placed that they divide it into four equal parts, thus uniting in one the twelve signs which set \nforth the blessed hope of a groaning creation, which waits for the Promised Seed of the woman \nto come and crush the serpent's head and bring in universal blessing.* * See The Witness of the Stars, by the same author. They are the four heads of animal creation: the lion, of wild beasts; the ox, of tame beasts; the \neagle, of birds; and man the head of all. Again we have the four divided into 3 + 1: three animal, \nand one human. They mark the purpose of God from the moment the curse was pronounced, and are the pledge that it will one day be removed. Other characteristics mark the cherubim off from all else. They are not Divine, for they are never worshiped, and all likeness of God was forbidden; moreover the God-head is presented at \nthe same time with them, for they are connected with His throne. They are distinguished from \nangels, and they are never dismissed on errands. They are distinguished from the Church in \nRevelation 5:9, 10, a passage which is supposed to prove their identity with it; for in verse 9, the \nword \"us\" should be omitted, with Lachmann, Tischendorf, Alford, Westcott and Hort, and the \nRV; and the words \"us\" and \"we\" in verse 10, should be \"them\" and \"they\" (with all the textual \nand ancient authorities), the verses reading as in RV:\u0160\"Thou wast slain, and didst purchase \nunto God with Thy blood, men of every tribe, and tongue, and people, and nation,* and madest \nthem to be unto our God a kingdom and priests; and they reign upon the earth.\" * Note the four-fold description. The fact, therefore, of the living creatures being four (and no other number) marks them as \nconnected with Creation, and as a symbolical representation that its hope of deliverance from the curse is bound up with the blood-shedding of the coming Redeemer.   THE FOUR-FOLD DIVISION OF MANKINDIn Genesis 10, \"the generations of the sons of Noah\" are comprised in a four-fold description. However the order may be varied, the number is preserved: Verse 5. lands, tongues, families, nations \nVerse 20. families, tongues, countries, nations \nVerse 31. families, tongues, lands, nations In Revelation there are seven similar descriptions, and though no two are alike, yet the number \nfour is preserved. See Revelation 5:9, 7:9, 10:11, 11:9, 13:7,* 14:6, 17:15. * In Rev 13:7, the AV gives only three; but the RV, with G., L., T., Tr., A., W. & H., give kai laon (kai laon), people, thus making four. The three in Genesis, and seven in Revelation make ten such descriptions in all, which is the number of ordinal perfection.   THE GREAT PROPHETIC WORLD-POWERSare four, and these are divided into 3 + 1, where the one stands out in great and marked contrast to the other three. The first three wild beasts are named (lion, bear, leopard); while the fourth is \nonly described and not named (7:7,23). So in the image of Nebuchadnezzar's dream, three are metals; one is a mixture of metal and mire! In Daniel 7:2, 3 we read, \"The FOUR winds of the heaven STROVE upon the great sea, and FOUR beasts came up from the sea DIVERSE one from another.\" Such is the history of man's \npower in the world\u0160strife and division! No sooner are mankind divided in Genesis 10, than Abraham is called out from them to walk with God (Gen 11, 12). But he soon finds it to be a world of strife and enmity, for Genesis 14 \nopens with the names of four kings, and \"these made war\" with five others which are named \nafterwards.   THE FOURTH BOOKof the Bible is Numbers. In Hebrew it is called B'Midbar, i.e., the Wilderness. The gematria of B'Midbar is 248 (4x62). It relates to the earth, which is a wilderness compared with Heaven; and to our pilgrimage through it. It tells of Meribah and striving (20:13), and records the history of the murmurings, \nrebellions, and wanderings.   THE FOURTH BOOK OF THE PSALMSis the Book of the Wilderness. The first Psalm is the \"Prayer of Moses, the man of God,\"\u0160the man of the wilderness. All the illustrations and metaphors, etc., are drawn from the earth, and \nthis fourth book sets forth Jehovah's counsels and purposes in relation to the earth. (See Psalms \n90-106.) In the First Book of the Psalms (1-41), the fourth Psalm has to do with earth.* It tells how there is nothing satisfying in it; that apart from God there can be no real prosperity in the earth. * The first Psalm speaks of Genesis and the counsels of God for \nman. The second tells of Exodus and deliverance from the hand of \nthe enemy. The third tells of Leviticus\u0160of Salvation being of the Lord, and how His blessing can be upon His people. \"Many there be that say, Who will show us any good? LORD, lift Thou up the light of Thy countenance upon us. \nThou hast put gladness in my heart \nMore than they have when their corn and their wine are increased.\" (Psa 4:6,7, \nRV) We may note also the fourth Psalms of the other Books of the Psalms, viz:\u0160Psalm 45 (the \nfourth of the second book), Psalm 76 (the fourth of the third book), Psalm 93 (the fourth of the \nfourth book), and Psalm 110 (the fourth of the fifth book). All these tell of Dominion in the \nearth, and they speak of the coming reign of earth's rightful King and Lord. The Fourth Commandment is the first that refers to the earth. The fourth clause of the Lord's Prayer is the first that mentions the earth. \n  FOUR IN CONTRAST WITH SEVENSeven stamps everything with spiritual perfection, for it is the number of heaven, and stands therefore in contrast to the earth. Hence, when in Revelation 5:12 the heavenly multitudes \npraise, they praise with a seven-fold blessing, and say: \"Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive (1) power, and (2) riches, and (3) wisdom, and (4) strength, and (5) honour, and (6) glory, and (7) blessing.\"Whereas in v. 13, when the created earthly beings praise,\u0160 the creatures that are \"on the earth, \nand under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them\"\u0160when these join in \ntheir ascription, it is only four-fold:\u0160(1) \"blessing, and (2) honour, and (3) glory, and (4) \npower, be unto Him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.\"   THE DEATH AND LIFE OF CHRISTare set forth by a four-fold type and record. \nHis death. the four great offerings (Psa 40:6).* a. \"Sacrifice [peace offering], and offering [meal offering], Thou wouldest not:b. Mine ears hast Thou opened.a. Burnt offering and sin offering hast Thou not required. b. Then said I, Lo, I come,\" etc.* Here the alternate structure shows that \"b\" and \"b\" relate to the obedience of Christ as the fifth great offering to which the four pointed. In the four Gospels we have the record of His life and obedience unto death. These are divided into 3 + 1, the three being similar, and hence called \"Synoptic\"; while the fourth stands out \nalone, written after the Churches had all failed, and presenting Christ not merely as offered and \nrejected by Israel, but as the one and only centre of union and unity after His rejection, and in \nthe midst of all the failure, confusion, and corruption.   THE SEVEN PARABLES OF MATTHEW 13are divided into four and three; and while the three are spoken inside the house (v 36) to the disciples, and reveal esoteric (or inner explanatory) truth, the four relate to exoteric truth, and \nconcern the outward aspect of things in relation to the world, and hence were spoken outside the \nhouse (v 1). But it is as composed of Three PLUS onethat we see the most marked illustrations of the ideal significance of the number four, the \"one\" marking an election out of the earth. Of the four great offerings, three were connected with blood and life; while one was meal. The meal offering (Lev 2) was either baked in three ways (oven, flat-plate, or frying-pan); or not at all. The sin offering (Lev 4) was offered for three classes of individuals\u0160 l     The Priest that is anointed (v 3), l     The Ruler (v 22), l     The Common person (v 27)\u0160 or for the whole congregation as one (v 13). The materials of the Tabernacle were four, three being metals (gold, silver, brass); and one non-metal (wood). The coverings of the Tabernacle were four,\u0160three animal (goats' hair, rams' skins, and badger skins*); and one vegetable (fine linen). * No badgers were ever found so far south as Palestine. The word #$xata (Tachash) is \na word of uncertain meaning, but it refers to an animal the skins of which were used \n(Exo 25:5, 26:14; Num 4:6,8, etc.). The ancient versions understand it as a colour (the \nLXX, Chald., and Syr., as red, Arabic, black). It was probably the red or dark skins of \nthe larger sacrificial animals; the two smaller animals are named as being goats and rams. The ornamentations of the curtains were four, three being colours (blue, purple and scarlet); while one was a pattern (the cherubim). The Priests and Levites were of four orders or persons: one was Aaron and his sons (Aaronites); the three were the sons of Gershon, Kohath, and Merari (Levites). The Manna (Exo 16:14,31) has a four-fold description, three referring to sight or appearance (small, white, round); and one to taste (sweet). Of the four prohibited or unclean animals, three chewed the cud, but did not divide the hoof (camel, hare, and coney); while one divided the hoof, but did not chew the cud (the swine); and \nthus the swine stands out in marked contrast to the other three. Of the four Houses of God (i.e., erected by Divine plan) in the earth, three were, or will be, material, viz., the Tabernacle, the Temple (Solomon's), and Ezekiel's; whilst the one is a Spiritual house (1 Peter 2:5). Four houses were built by Solomon; three were for himself,\u0160his own house (1 Kings 7:1), the house of the forest of Lebanon (v 2), the house for Pharaoh's daughter (v 8); while one was the \nHouse of the LORD (1 Kings 6:37). God's four sore judgments in the earth (Eze 14:21): three are inanimate (the sword, famine, and pestilence); while one is animate (the noisome beast). In Jeremiah 15:3, they are still four, but three are animate (dogs, fowls, and beasts), and one is inanimate (the sword). Of the four kinds of flesh in 1 Corinthians 15:39, three are animals (beasts, birds, and fishes); while one is human (man). The four glories of 1 Corinthians 15:40, 41: three are celestial and are detailed (the sun, moon, and stars); while one is not detailed and is terrestrial. The body is sown and raised (1 Cor 15:42-44) in three ways that relate to corruptibility: l     sown \"in corruption, raised in incorruption\"; l     sown \"in dishonour, raised in glory\"; l     sown \"in weakness, raised in power\"; while in the one, \"it is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body.\" In the parable of the sower (Matt 13) the kinds of soil are four; but three are characterised as being all alike in contrast to the one (viz., the wayside, the stony ground, and the thorns). These \nare all unprepared! while the one is good because it is prepared! The essence of the parable lies \nin this. It reduces the four soils to two, and confirms what is said of the two religions on pp. 96, 97. In the Lost Son's welcome (Luke 15), three things were material (the robe, the ring, and the shoes); while one was moral (the kiss). \"The Seventy\" went forth with a four-fold prohibition (Luke 10:4), of which three related to matters (carry no purse, no scrip, no shoes); while one related to action (\"salute no man by the \nway\"). God's four-fold witness in the earth (Heb 2:4): three are impersonal (signs, wonders, and miracles), and one personal (the gifts of the Holy Ghost).   FOURS OF PERSONSThe four of the Book of Job:\u0160 l     Eliphaz l     Bildad l     Zophar (friends) l     Elihu (mediator) The children of Lamech:\u0160 l     Jubal l     Jabal l     Tubal-Cain (sons) l     Naamah (daughters) The four bound with brass:\u0160 l     Samson (Judg 16:21) [not liberated] l     Jehoiachim (2 Chron 36:6) [not liberated] l     Zedekiah (2 Kings 25:7; Jer 52:11, 39:7) [not liberated] l     Manasseh (2 Chron 33:11) [liberated] The four whose names were changed:\u0160 l     Abram (Gen 27:5) [in blessing] l     Sarai (Gen 27:15) [in blessing] l     Jacob (35:10, 37:28) [in blessing] l     Pashur (Jer 20:3) [in judgment] Four Prophetesses of the Old Testament:\u0160 l     Miriam (Exo 15:20) [good] l     Deborah (Judg 4:4) [good] l     Huldah (2 Kings 22:14) [good] l     Noadiah (Neh 6:14) [bad] The four \"children\" of the Book of Daniel:\u0160 l     Daniel [alone] l     Shadrach [together] l     Meshach [together] l     Abednego [together] The four in the furnace: l     Shadrach [human] l     Meshach [human] l     Abednego [human] l     The son of God, Spiritual.* * There is no article. It is literally \"a son of God,\" i.e. an angel. The four kings named in Daniel:\u0160 l     Nebuchadnezzar (1-4) [the first of Babylon] l     Belshazzar (5) [the last of Babylon] l     Darius (6) \"the Median\" (5:31) l     Cyrus (6:28, 10:1) \"the Persian\" The four women in the Lord's genealogy (Matt 1):\u0160 l     Thamar (Gen 38:27, &c.; Matt 1:3) l     Rahab (Ruth 4:20; Matt 1:5) l     Ruth (Ruth 4:13,14; Matt 1:5) l     Wife of Uriah (2 Sam 12:24; Matt 1:6) Four names of Satan in Revelation 20:2:\u0160 l     The Dragon [rebellious and apostate] l     The Old Serpent [seductive] l     The Devil [accusing] l     Satan [personal] The four-fold witness to show Nature's inability to find wisdom (Job 28:7,8):\u0160 l     The fowl. l     The vulture's eye. l     The lion's whelps. l     The fierce lion. Four things \"little and wise\" (Prov 30:24-28):\u0160 l     The ant. l     The coney. l     The locust. l     The spider. The brazen altar which displayed the Divine judgment is four sided, and had four horns. So with the golden altar. The camp was four-square. The rainbow, which has special reference to the earth and its judgment, is mentioned four times,\u0160twice in the Old Testament (Gen 9 and Eze 1:28) and twice in the New Testament (Rev 4:3, 10:1). The fulness of material blessing in the earth is described in Isaiah 60:17:\u0160 l     For brass I will bring gold. l     For iron I will bring silver. l     For wood I will bring brass. l     For stones I will bring iron. The sphere of suffering is four-fold in 2 Corinthians 4:8, 9:\u0160 l     Troubled, but not distressed. l     Perplexed, but not in despair. l     Persecuted, but not forsaken. l     Cast down, but not destroyed. The prophecy of Zechariah which has special reference to the earth:\u0160 l     In Chapter 1 we have the four horns or Gentile powers, and the four carpenters to fray them. l     In chapter 4 we have the four chariots with horses of four colours, signifying the spirits \nof the heavens acting for God in the midst of the four Gentile powers.   GEMATRIAThis is too large a subject to enter on here, but it is most significant that we get the number four \nin its concentrated form in connection with q#&em@ed@a, DAMASCUS, which is the oldest \ncity in the world. The number of its name is 444: thus\u0160 d = 4 444m \n= 40# = 300q = 100The name occurs 39 times, i.e., 3 x 13, for the significance of which see under the number 13.   WORDS THAT OCCUR FOUR TIMESpartake also the same significance. We give a few from the commencement of the alphabet, and a careful study of them and others will bring out much interesting and instructive information: l     hdb) (aveh-dah), \"lost thing,\" Exo 22:9; Lev 6:3,4; Deut 22:3 l     hbg (gah-vah), \"high-look or proud,\" Psa 101:5; Prov 16:5; Eccl 7:8; Eze 31:3 l     hng (gin-nah), \"garden,\" Esth 1:5, 7:7,8; Song 6:11 l     lgd (dah-gal), \"banners,\" Psa 20:6; Song 5:10, 6:4,10 l     Kd (dack), \"oppressed or afflicted,\" Psa 9:9, 10:18, 74:21; Prov 26:28 l     hbrx (chah-rah-vah), \"dry land,\" 8 times (2x4) l     #rx (cheh-resh), \"craftsmen,\" Josh 2:1 (\"secretly,\" i.e. as craftsmen), 1 Chron 4:14, \nmarg.; Neh 11:35; Isa 3:3 (\"cunning\") l     trk#m (mas-koh-reth), \"wages,\" Gen 19:15, 31:7,41; \"reward,\" Ruth 2:12.* * But \"gift\" occurs five times. l     xsn (nah-sach), \"plucked,\" Deut 28:63; \"pluck,\" Psa 52:7; \"rooted out,\" Prov 2:22; \n\"destroy,\" 15:25 l     rcn (neh-tzer), \"branch,\" Isa 11:1, 14:19, 60:21; Dan 11:7 l     )#n (nah-shah), \"to be in debt,\" 1 Sam 22:2; Neh 5:7; Psa 89:22; Isa 24:2 l     agnoia (agnoia), \"ignorance,\" Acts 3:17, 17:30; Eph 4:18; 1 Peter 1:14 l     agrupnew (agrupneo), \"watch,\" Mark 13:33; Luke 21:36; Eph 6:18; Heb 13:17 l     aition (aition), \"fault,\" Luke 23:4,14,22; Acts 19:40 l     amnoV (amnos), \"Lamb,\" John 1:29,36; Acts 8:32; 1 Peter 1:19 l     anqoV (anthos), \"flower,\" James 1:10,11; 1 Peter 1:24 (twice) l     asthr (asteer), \"star,\" 24 times (4x6)* * The two words together 28 times (4x7). l     astron (astron), star,\" Luke 21:25; Acts 7:43, 27:20; Heb 11:12* l     apostolh (apostolee), \"apostleship,\" Acts 1:25; Rom 1:5; 1 Cor 9:2; Gal 2:8   ADDITIONAL MISCELLANEOUS ILLUSTRATIONSFour times \"Eve\" mentioned in the Bible by name:\u0160 l     Genesis 3:20 l     Genesis 4:1 l     2 Corinthians 11:3 l     1 Timothy 2:13   Back | Contents | Next  Back | Contents | Next PART II ITS SPIRITUAL SIGNIFICANCE FIVEFive is four plus one (4+1). We have had hitherto the three persons of the Godhead, and their manifestation in creation. Now we have a further revelation of a People called out from \nmankind, redeemed and saved, to walk with God from earth to heaven. Hence, Redemption \nfollows creation. Inasmuch as in consequence of the fall of man creation came under the curse \nand was \"made subject to vanity,\" therefore man and creation must be redeemed. Thus we have: 1.  Father \n2.  Son \n3.  Spirit \n4.  Creation \n5.  Redemption These are the five great mysteries, and five is therefore the number of GRACE. If four is the number of the world, then it represents man's weakness, and helplessness, and vanity, as we have seen. But four plus one (4+1=5) is significant of Divine strength added to and made perfect in that weakness; of omnipotence combined with the impotence of earth; of Divine favour uninfluenced \nand invincible. The word \"the earth\" is Cr)h (Ha-Eretz). The gematria of this word is 296, a multiple of four; while the word for \"the heavens\" is Mym#h (Ha-shemayeem), the gematria of which is 395, a multiple of five The gematria of h cariV (grace) is 725, a multiple of the square of five (52x29). The numerical value of the words \"My grace is sufficient for thee\" ('Arkei soi h cariV mou) is 1845, of which the factors are 5 x 32 x 41. (See pp. 76,77.) Grace means favour. But what kind of favour? for favour is of many kinds. Favour shown to the miserable we call mercy; favour shown to the poor we call pity; favour shown to the suffering \nwe call compassion; favour shown to the obstinate we call patience: but favour shown to the \nunworthy we call GRACE! This is favour indeed; favour which is truly Divine in its source and in its character. Light is thrown upon it in Romans 3:24, \"being justified freely by His grace.\" The word here translated \"freely\" occurs again in John 15:25, and is translated \"without a \ncause\" (\"they hated me without a cause\"). Was there any real cause why they hated the Lord \nJesus? No! Nor is there any cause in us why God should ever justify us. So we might read \nRomans 3:24 thus: \"Being justified without a cause by His grace.\" Yes, this is grace \nindeed,\u0160favour to the unworthy. It was so with Abram. There was no cause in him why God should have called him and chosen him! There was no cause why God should have made an unconditional covenant with him and \nhis seed for ever. Therefore the number five shall be stamped upon this covenant by causing it to \nbe made with five sacrifices\u0160a heifer, a goat, a ram, a dove, and a pigeon (Gen 15:9). See pp. 54, 113. It is remarkable, also, that afterwards, when God changed Abram's name to Abraham (Gen \n17:5), the change was made very simply, but very significantly (for there is no chance with \nGod), by inserting in the middle of it the fifth letter of the alphabet, h (Hey), the symbol of the number five, and Mrb), Abram, became Mhrb) AbraHam (Gen 17:5). All this was of grace, and it is stamped with this significance. It is worthy of note that this change was made at a particular moment. It was when Abraham was called to \"walk before\" God in a very special manner. He \nwas to look for the promised \"seed\" from no earthly source, and thus he was to \"walk by faith \nand not by sight.\" It was at this moment that God revealed Himself for the first time by His \nname of EL SHADDAI, i.e. the all bountiful One! able to supply all Abraham's need; able to \nmeet all his necessities; able to do for him all that he required. How gracious! How suitable! \nHow perfect! It is the same in 2 Corinthians 6:17, 18, when we are called, as Abraham was, to \n\"come out,\" to \"be separate,\" and walk by faith with God. He reveals himself (for the first time \nin the New Testament) by the same wonderful name, \"Ye shall be My sons and daughters, saith \nthe Lord ALMIGHTY\"!\u0160able to support and to sustain you; able to supply all your need. This \nis grace.   THE FIFTH BOOK OF THE BIBLE (DEUTERONOMY)magnifies the grace of God, and in it special pains, so to speak, are taken to emphasise the great fact that not for the sake of the people, but for God's own Name's sake had He called, and \nchosen, and blessed them. Read Deuteronomy 4:7, 20, 32, 37, 8:11, 17, etc.   THE FIFTH BOOK OF PSALMSsets forth the same great fact. Its first Psalm (Psa 107) magnifies this, and shows how \"He sent His word and healed them\" (v 20), and again and again delivered them out of all their trouble.   THE FIFTH PSALM OF THE FIRST BOOKhas also special reference to God's \"FAVOUR,\" or grace, with which He encompasses His people. Psalm 5:12, \"For thou LORD wilt bless the righteous; with FAVOUR wilt Thou \ncompass him [Heb. crown him] as with a shield.\"   THE \"STONE\" KINGDOMwill be the fifth kingdom, succeeding and comprehending the four great world-powers, absorbing all earthly dominion, when the kingdoms of this world shall become the kingdom of \nour Lord and of His Anointed, and He shall reign in glory and in grace.   ISRAEL CAME OUT OF EGYPTfive in a rank. In Exodus 13:18 it says, \"The children of Israel went up harnessed out of the land of Egypt.\" In the margin it says they went up by five in a rank, My#mx from #mx, five. It may \nbe in ranks, i.e. fifties, as in 2 Kings 1:9 and Isaiah 3:5.* The point is that they went up in \nperfect weakness; helpless, and defenceless; but they were invincible through the presence of \nJehovah in their midst. * In Joshua 1:14, \"Ye shall pass over before your brethren armed.\" Margin: \"Heb., \nmarshalled by five.\" This may have some reference to the fact that the number five \nwas specially hateful to the Egyptians, if indeed it were not the cause of such hatred. \nSir Gardner Wilkinson tells us that even down to the present day the number five is \nregarded as an evil number in modern Egypt. On their watches the fifth hour, \"V,\" is marked by a small circle, \"o.\"   \"FIVE SMOOTH STONES\"were chosen by David when he went to meet the giant enemy of Israel (1 Sam 17:40). They were significant of his own perfect weakness supplemented by Divine strength. And he was \nstronger in this weakness than in all the armour of Saul. It is worthy of note that after all he used \nonly the one, not any of the four. That one was sufficient to conquer the mightiest foe.   IT WAS THE FIFTH BOOKthat David's son and David's Lord used in His conflict with that great enemy of whom Goliath was the faintest type. It was only the Book of Deuteronomy which formed the one stone with \nwhich he defeated the Devil himself (compare Matt 4:1-11 and Deut 8:3, 6:13,16). No wonder that this Book of Deuteronomy is the object of Satan's hatred. \"No marvel\" that today his ministers, \"transformed as the ministers of righteousness\" (2 Cor 11:14,15), are engaged in the \nattempt to demolish this Book of Deuteronomy with their destructive criticism. But their labour \nis all in vain, for it is stamped with the number which marks the omnipotence of Jehovah's \npower and grace.   THE PROMISE\"Five of you shall chase a thousand, and a hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight\" (Lev 26:8), conveys the truth elsewhere revealed;\u0160\"If God be for us who can be against us?\" (Rom \n8:31). But note, it does not say \"five shall chase a thousand\"; but \"five OF YOU,\"\u0160five of those \nwhom God has redeemed and delivered, and whom He will strengthen with His own might.   THE PREFERENCE\"I had rather speak five words with the understanding, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue\" (1 Cor 14:19). That is to say, a few words spoken in the fear of God, in human \nweakness, depending on Divine strength and blessing, will be able to accomplish that which \nGod has purposed; while words without end will be spoken in vain. Man may applaud the latter \nand bestow his admiration on their eloquence. But God will own only the former, and follow \nthem with this blessing, making them to work effectually in them that believe (1 Thess 1:6, \n2:13).   JEHOVAH'S DEMAND TO PHARAOHwas five-fold in its nature, because it was the expression of His grace in this deliverance of His people. It brought out, therefore, five distinct objections from Pharaoh. Jehovah's demand \nsprang purely from His own spontaneous grace. Nothing necessitated it; neither Israel's misery \nnor Israel's merit called it forth. \"God heard their groaning, and God remembered HIS covenant \nwith Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob. And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God \nhad respect unto them\" (Exo 2:24,25). It was not their covenant with God, as with Israel \nafterwards at Sinai; but it was God's covenant which HE had made with their fathers. All was of \ngrace. Hence, Jehovah's demand to Pharaoh (in Exo 5:1) was stamped by the five great facts \nwhich it embraced: 1.  Jehovah and His Word.\u0160\"Thus saith Jehovah, God of Israel.\" To this was opposed the objection of Pharaoh (v 2), \"Who is Jehovah that I should obey His voice?\" 2.  Jehovah's People.\u0160\"Let my people go.\" To this Pharaoh objected (10:9-11), \"Who are they that shall go?\" Moses said, \"We will go with our young and with our old, and with \nour sons and with our daughters, etc.\" \"Not so; go now, ye that are men\" (10:11), was \nPharaoh's reply. In other words, God's people consist of His redeemed; and the enemy will be quite content for parents to go and serve God in the wilderness, provided they will leave their little ones behind in Egypt! 3.  Jehovah's Demand.\u0160\"Let my people go.\" No, said Pharaoh; \"Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land\" (8:25). And many think today that they can worship in Egypt, but \n\"Moses said, It is not meet so to do\" (8:26). 4.  Jehovah's Feast.\u0160\"That they may hold a feast unto me.\" Pharaoh's objection was (10:24), \"Go ye, serve the LORD; only let your flocks and your herds be stayed.\" How \nsubtle was the opposition! But how perfect was Moses' reply (10:26), \"We know not \nwith what we must serve the LORD until we come thither.\" We cannot know God's will \nfor us until we are on God's ground. Light for the second step will not be given until we \nhave used the light given for the first. 5.  Jehovah's Separation.\u0160\"In the wilderness.\" When Pharaoh objected to their going at all, and wished them to serve God \"in the land,\" Moses insisted on a separation of \"three \ndays' journey into the wilderness\" (8:27). There must be a divinely perfect separation of \nthe redeemed from Egypt and all its belongings. See p. 113. But now Pharaoh's objection is more subtle. He said (8:28), \"I will let you go, that ye \nmay sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very far \naway!\" Oh! how many yield to this temptation, and are always within easy reach of the \nworld. Living within the borderland, they are always open to the enemy's enticements, \nand always in danger of his snares. Behold, here, then, the perfection of grace, manifested in the demand of Jehovah for those \n\"whom He hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy\" (Psa 107:2). Each of its five-fold parts \nwas stoutly resisted by the enemy, but the grace of Jehovah is invincible.   THE TABERNACLEhad five for its all-pervading number; nearly every measurement was a multiple of five. Before mentioning these measurements we ought to notice that worship itself is all of grace! No one \ncan worship except those who are sought and called of the Father (John 4:23). \"Blessed is the \nman whom Thou choosest and causest to approach unto Thee, that he may dwell in Thy courts; \nwe shall be satisfied with the goodness of Thy house, even of Thy holy temple\" (Psa 65:4). The Divine title of the book we call Leviticus is in the Hebrew Canon \"He CALLED.\" It is the book of worship, showing how those who are to worship must be called by God, and showing \nhow He wills to be approached. The book opens with the direction that if any man will bring an \noffering to the Lord he shall bring such and such an offering. The offerers and the priests are \ntold minutely all that is to be done. Nothing is left to their imagination. We have seen that Leviticus is the third book of the Bible. It comes to us stamped with the number of Divine perfection. The opening words are, \"And Jehovah spake,\" an expression which occurs in the book 36 times (32x22).* * Lev 4:1, 5:14, 6:1,8,19,24, 7:22,28, 8:1, 10:8, 11:1, 12:1, 13:1, 14:1,33, 15:1, 16:1,2, 17:1, 18:1, 19:1, 20:1, 21:1,16, 22:1,17,26, 23:1,9,23,26,33, 24:1,13, 25:1, 27:1. Indeed, this third book is unique, consisting, as it does, almost wholly of the words of Jehovah. No other book of the Bible is so full of Divine utterances. It is fitting, therefore, that the number \nthree should be stamped upon it. l     \"I AM JEHOVAH\" occurs 21 times (3x7).* l     \"I AM THE JEHOVAH YOUR GOD\" occurs 21 times (3x7).** l     \"I JEHOVAH AM\" occurs three times (19:1, 20:26; 21:8); and \"I JEHOVAH DO\" \ntwice (21:15, 22:9), or five times together. * Lev 11:45, 28:5,6,22, 19:12,14,16,18,28,30,32,37, 20:8, 21:12, \n22:2,8,31,32,33, 26:2,45. ** Lev 11:44, 28:4,30, 19:3,4,10,25,31,34,36, 20:7,24, 23:22,43, 24:22, 25:17,38,55, 26:1,13,44. Here then we have Divine communication, and the number of Deity stamped upon it. This might have been brought out under the number three, but it is well to have it here in connection with \nworship as springing from the will of God, and being founded in grace. The Tabernacle has this number of grace (five) stamped upon it. The outer court was 100 cubits long and 50 cubits wide. On either side were 20 pillars, and along each end were 10 pillars, or 60 in all; that is 5 x 12, or grace in governmental display \nbefore the world, 12 being the number of the Tribes. The pillars that held up the curtains were 5 cubits apart and 5 cubits high, and the whole of the outer curtain was divided into squares of 25 cubits (5x5). Each pair of pillars thus supported an area of 52 cubits of fine white linen, thus witnessing to the perfect grace by which alone God's people can witness for Him before the world. Their own righteousness (the fine linen) is \"filthy rags\" (Isa 64:6), and we can only say \"by the grace of God I am what I am\" (1 Cor 15)\u0160a sinner \nsaved by grace. This righteousness is based on atonement, for 5 x 5 was also the measure of the \nbrazen altar of burnt offering. This was the perfect answer of Christ to God's righteous \nrequirements, and to what was required of man. True, this brazen altar was only 3 cubits high, but this tells us that the provision was Divine in its origin, that atonement emanates solely from God. The building itself was 10 cubits high, 10 cubits wide, and 30 cubits long. Its length was divided into two unequal parts, the Holy place being 20 cubits long; and the Holy of Holies 10 cubits, \nbeing therefore a perfect cube of 10 cubits. It was formed of forty-eight boards, twenty on either \nside, and eight at the end, the front being formed of a curtain hung on five pillars. These forty-eight boards (3x42) are significant of the nation as before God in the fulness of privilege on the earth (4x12). The twenty boards on each side were held together by five bars passing through rings which were attached to them. The curtains which covered the Tabernacle structure were four in number. The first was made of ten curtains of byssus in various colours adorned with embroidered cherubim. Each curtain was 28 (4x7) cubits long and four wide. They were hung five on each side, probably sewn \ntogether to form one large sheet (20x28); the two sheets coupled together by loops, and fifty \n(5x10) taches of gold. The second covering was formed of eleven curtains of goats' hair, each 30 \ncubits long and four wide, joined together in two sheets fastened by loops and taches of brass. \nThe third was of rams' skins dyed red, and the fourth was of tachash (or coloured) skins,* of \nwhich the dimensions are not given. * Probably of a sacrificial animal. See p. 129. The Entrance Vails were three in number. The first was \"the gate of the court,\" 20 cubits wide \nand 5 high, hung on 5 pillars. The second was \"the door of the Tabernacle,\" 10 cubits wide and \n10 high, hung like the gate of the court on 5 pillars. The third was the \"beautiful vail,\" also 10 \ncubits square, which divided the Holy place from the Holy of Holies. One feature of these three \nvails is remarkable. The dimensions of the vail of the court and those of the Tabernacle were \ndifferent, but yet the area was the same. The former was 20 cubits by 5 = 100 cubits; the latter \nwere 10 cubits by 10, equaling 100 cubits also. Thus while there was only one gate, one door, \none vail, they each typified Christ as the only door of entrance for all the blessings connected \nwith salvation. But note that the \"gate\" which admitted to the benefits of atonement was wider \nand lower (20 cubits wide, and 5 cubits high); while the door which admitted to worship was \nboth higher and narrower, being only 10 cubits wide, half the width, and twice the height (10 \ncubits high); thus saying to us, that not all who experience the blessings of atonement \nunderstand or appreciate the true nature of spiritual worship. The highest worship\u0160admittance \nto the mercy-seat\u0160was impossible for the Israelites except in the person of their substitute\u0160the \nhigh priest; for the beautiful vail barred their access. Yet this vail was rent in twain the moment \nthe true grace which came by Jesus Christ was perfectly manifested. And it was rent by the act \nof God in grace, for it was rent \"from the top to the bottom.\" It is worthy of note, and it is a subject which might well be further investigated by those who have leisure, that the Gematria of Hebrews 9, which gives an account of the Tabernacle, yields \nthe number five as a factor. Taking each letter as standing for its corresponding figure, the value \nof Hebrews 9:2-10, describing the Tabernacle and its furniture, is 103,480. The factors of this \nnumber are all full of significance, viz., 5 x 8 x 13 x 199; where we have five the number of \ngrace, four the number of the world, the sphere in which it is manifested, while in thirteen we \nhave the number of sin and atonement. (See under Thirteen.) In like manner the second section of the chapter (Heb 9:11-28), which relates to the application of the type to Christ and His atoning work, is a simple multiple of thirteen, viz., 204,451 \n(13x15,727). While the important digression in verses 16, 17, and 18, amounts to 11,830, which is 132 x 14 x 5, where we have the same great important factors.   THE PREPOSITIONS CONNECTED WITH SUBSTITUTIONused in connection with atonement, expressing Christ's death on behalf of His people, occur also in multiples of five:\u0160 uper (huper), which means on behalf of, in the interests of, occurs 585 times, the factors of this being 5 x 13 x 9, i.e., grace, atonement, and judgment. peri (peri), a word of similar sense and usage, meaning about or concerning, occurs 195 times, of which the factors are 5 x 13 x 3, or grace, atonement, and divinity.   THE HOLY ANOINTING OIL (Exo 30:23-25)was composed of five parts, for it was a revelation of pure grace. This five is marked by the numbers four and one. For four parts were spices, and one was oil. The four principal species:\u0160 1.  Myrrh, 500 shekels (5x100). 2.  Sweet cinnamon, 250 shekels (5x50). \n3.  Sweet calamus, 250 shekels (5x50). \n4.  Cassia, 500 shekels (5x100). And olive oil, one hin. This anointing oil was holy, for it separated to God; nothing else could separate. It was of God, and therefore of grace; and therefore the number of its ingredients was five, and their quantities \nwere all multiples of five. Seven classes of persons or things were consecrated with this holy oil:\u0160 1.  Aaron and his sons. 2.  The Tabernacle itself. \n3.  The table and its vessels. \n4.  The candlestick and its furniture. \n5.  The altar of burnt offering and its vessels. \n6.  The altar of incense. \n7.  The laver and its foot. The word for \"consecration\" and the act are so misunderstood that it may be well to make a \npassing note upon it. The Hebrew is )lm (Mah-leh). It means, to fill, fill up, complete. Its first \noccurrence is Genesis 1:22, \"multiply and fill the waters in the seas.\" So 21:19, \"she filled the \nbottle with water\"; 29:21, \"My days are fulfilled\"; Exodus 15:9, \"My soul shall have its fill of \nthem\"; 28:41, \"Thou shalt fill their hand.\" This has been translated consecrate, which is a \ncomment rather than a translation. When this word is used with the word dy (yad), hand, it means to fill the hand, especially with that which is the sign and symbol of office, i.e., to fill the hand with a sceptre was to set apart or consecrate to the office of king. To fill the hand with certain parts of sacrifices, was to set apart \nfor the office of priest and to confirm their right to offer both gifts and sacrifices to God, Exodus \n29:22-25, 28:41, 29:9, 32:29. (See also Heb 5:1, 8:3,4.) A \"ram of consecration\" (or of filling) \nwas a ram with parts of which the hands of the priests were filled when they were set apart to \ntheir office. Whenever the word refers to official appointment, or separation to a work or dignity, it is the sovereign act of God, and the accompanying symbolical act was the filling of the hand of the \nperson so appointed with the sign which marked his office. Hence the verb means in this usage \nto invest with an office, to communicate a dignity. It is needless to say that no man can do this \nfor himself. It must be the act of God. When the word is used of what man can do it is followed by the preposition l, which means \"to\" or \"for,\" as in 2 Chronicles 29:31, to fill the hand for one, i.e., to bring offerings (to Jehovah), \nwhich is quite a different thing altogether. There is no idea here of what is called today, \n\"consecration.\" It is a simple offering of gifts, which the offerer brings in his hands. Only Jehovah Himself can invest a man with the privilege of any office in His service. \"No man taketh this honour unto himself but he that is called of God\" (Heb 5:4). Hence the Lord Jesus is specially called \"the Anointed,\" which is in Hebrew Messiah, and in Greek CriostoV, Christos, and in English Christ. Those who vainly talk about \"consecrating themselves\" should read 2 \nChronicles 13:9. At the consecration of the priest under the Old Covenant in Exodus 29:20, the numbers three and five accompany the act of Divine grace. Three acts, each associated with five. The blood, \nand afterwards the holy oil upon it, was put\u0160 1.  On the tip of the right ear, signifying that the Holy Spirit would cause him to hear the Word of God, and separating his five senses for God; 2.  On the thumb of his right hand (one of the five digits), signifying that he was to do and act for God; 3.  On the great toe of his right foot (again five), signifying that his personal walk was to be conformed to God's Word. Thus it is now that the Holy Spirit consecrates all who are priests unto God. It is a Divine act, an \nact of sovereign grace. A grand reality when done for the sinner by God the Holy Ghost, but a \nworthless vanity when presumptuously done by a mortal man.   THE INCENSE (Exo 30:34)also was composed of five parts. Four were \"sweet spices,\" Myms (Sa-meem), and one was salt. xlm, to salt, being rendered \"tempered together.\" See verse 35, margin. The four \"sweet spices\" were:\u0160 1.  \"Stacte,\" P+n (Nataph), \"to drop\"; hence a drop of aromatic gum. The LXX is stakth from spazein, \"to drop.\" The Rabbins call it opobalsamum, as the RV margin. 2.  \"On'ycha,\" tlx# (Sh'cheyleth), \"a shell\"; Greek onux, the shell of a species of mussel which burnt with an odour of musk. 3.  \"Gal'banum,\" hnblx (Chel-b'nah), \"a fragrant gum.\" 4.  \"Frankincense,\" hnwbl (L'bonah), \"a bright burning gum.\" \n5.  The one, salt. The verb xlm (Mah-lach), \"to salt,\" occurs only here and Leviticus 2:13 and Ezekiel 16:4, from which its meaning may be seen. This incense was called by various names,\u0160\"pure,\" \"perpetual,\" \"sweet,\" \"holy.\" No imitation of it was allowed. It indicates those precious merits of Christ through which alone our prayers can go up with acceptance before God. The incense was to symbolise \"the prayers of the saints\" \noffered by Christ Himself (Rev 5:3). Our prayers are real prayers only when they ascend \nthrough His merits. The smoke of the incense was always associated with the smoke of the burnt offering! It was the fire from the brazen altar which kindled the incense on the golden altar! It was fire of no earthly origin. It came down originally from heaven (Lev 9:24; Judg 6:21; 1 Kings 18:38; 1 Chron 21:26; 2 Chron 7:1). Incense kindled with \"strange fire\" was visited with \nimmediate death (Lev 10:1; Num 3:4, 26:61). And incense not made of the prescribed five \ningredients was forbidden to be offered (Exo 30:9). Solemn provisions these, when we apply them to our prayers. They show us that our own words are nothing, and that Christ's merits are everything. David said, \"Let my prayer be set forth before Thee as incense; and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice\" (Psa 141:2), i.e., as incense goes up (Heb. directed) to Thee, \nand the smoke of the burnt offering (the evening sacrifice), so let my prayers be accepted \nthrough the merits of that sacrifice. \"There was given unto him much incense that he should offer it WITH the prayers of all saints...and the smoke of the incense which came WITH the prayers of the saints, ascended up before \nGod out of the angel's hand\" (Rev 8:3,4). Rome has of course perverted this in her Vulgate \nVersion, and in her various translations of it. She reads (Rev 8), ut daret de orationibus \nsanctorum omnium, i.e., \"that he might offer the prayers of all the saints.\" And verse 4, et \nascendit fumus incensorum de orationibus sanctorum, i.e., \"and the smoke of the incense of the \nprayers of the saints ascended.\" The incense and the prayers are perfectly distinct; the one \nrepresents the merits of Christ, the other our imperfect prayers. But Rome confuses them, and \nher reason for doing so is shown by the notes which she puts in her various versions. The \nteaching of Scripture is clear, that apart from Christ's merits all our prayers are absolutely \nworthless. Hence the exhortation in Hebrews 13:15, \"BY HIM therefore let us offer the sacrifice \nof praise to God continually; that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to His name\" (see Lev \n7:12; Psa 51:12; Hosea 14:3, LXX).   WORDS THAT OCCUR FIVE TIMESAmong many words stamped with this significance are:\u0160 l     Ntm (Mat-tahn), \"gift\" (Gen 34:12; Num 18:11; Prov 18:16, 19:6, 21:14). It is suitable that this word should occur five times, for gifts are of grace. It is noteworthy that trk#m (mas-koh-reth), \"wages,\" occurs four times, for wages are of the earth, earthy. l     Nwyqn (nik-kah-yohn), \"innocency\" (Gen 20:5; Psa 26:6, 73:13; Hosea 8:5; Amos 4:6). l     paraklhtoV (parakleetos), translated Comforter four times in the Gospel of John, viz., 14:16, 26, 15:26, and 16:7; and Advocate once in the Epistle, 1 John 2:1. What a gracious provision! one Advocate within us (the Holy Spirit) that we may not sin (spoken of four times); and another with the Father for us if we do sin\u0160even \"Jesus \nChrist the righteous.\" The word means one called to one's side to give any help and to \nmeet any need. Two advocates speaking of the enemy which causes our need, and of the \nHelper who supplies it. Other words are:\u0160 l     agalliasiV (agalliasis), \"gladness\" (Luke 1:14; Acts 2:46; Heb 1:9), \"joy\" (Luke \n1:44), \"exceeding joy\" (Jude 24). l     adw (ado), \"to sing\" (Eph 5:19; Col 3:16; Rev 5:9, 14:3, 15:3). l     anapausiV (anapausis), \"rest\" (Matt 11:29, 12:43; Luke 11:24; Rev 4:8, 14:11). l     asfalhV (asphalees), \"certainty\" (Acts 21:34, 22:30, 25:26; Phil 3:1; Heb 6:19).   PHRASES WHICH OCCUR FIVE TIMESl     \"Bless the Lord, O my soul.\"\u0160All in Psalms 103 and 104, viz., 103:1, 2, 23 and 104:1, \n35. The Talmud calls attention to this and says, \"As God fills the earth and nourishes it, \nso He nourishes and blesses the soul.\" l     \"Whosoever hath, to him shall be given\" (Matt 13:12, 25:29; Mark 4:25; Luke 8:18, \n19:26).\u0160Five times, telling of the grace which gives. l     \"The kingdom of God.\"\u0160Five times in the Gospel (Matthew) which alone speaks of \n\"the kingdom of heaven.\" The latter refers to earth, and the kingdom to be established \nhere. While the former relates to the larger kingdom of grace, which includes it and the \nChurch and all beside (Matt 6:33, 12:8, 19:24, 21:31 and 43). The Talmud (Yoma, fol. 21, col. 2) asks (under Hagg 1:8), \"How is it that the word dbk)w, 'And \nI will be glorified,' is written without the final h (which stands for five) and is yet read as if it \nhad it (hbk)w)? Because it indicates that the second Temple lacked five things that were found in \nthe first Temple, viz:\u0160 l     The Ark that is the mercy-seat of the Cherubim, l     The Fire from heaven on the altar, l     The Shechinah, l     The Spirit of prophecy, and l     The Urim and Thummim.\" This answer is correct as far as it goes, but it is written nevertheless, in Haggai 2:9, \"The glory \nof this latter house shall be greater than the former.\" True, it lacked the Law that was contained in the Ark, but it had the presence of Him who was full of grace and truth, and who had that Law within His heart.   Back | Contents | Next  Back | Contents | Next PART II ITS SPIRITUAL SIGNIFICANCE SIXSix is either 4 plus 2, i.e., man's world (4) with man's enmity to God (2) brought in: or it is 5 plus 1, the grace of God made of none effect by man's addition to it, or perversion, or corruption \nof it: or it is 7 minus 1, i.e., man's coming short of spiritual perfection. In any case, therefore, it \nhas to do with man; it is the number of imperfection; the human number; the number of MAN as \ndestitute of God, without God, without Christ. The Hebrew #$#$' (shaish) is supposed to be derived from the root #$da#$af (shah-dash), but nothing is known about its origin or signification. At any rate it is certain that man was created on the sixth day, and thus he has the number six impressed upon him. Moreover, six days were appointed to him for his labour; while one day is \nassociated in sovereignty with the Lord God, as His rest. Six, therefore, is the number of labour also, of man's labour as apart and distinct from God's rest. True, it marks the completion of Creation as God's work, and therefore the number is significant \nof secular completeness. The serpent also was created on the sixth day. \nThe Sixth Commandment relates to the worst sin,\u0160murder. The sixth clause of the Lord's prayer treats of sin. Six is the number stamped on all that is connected with human labour. We see it stamped upon his measures which he uses in his labour, and on the time during which he labours. And we see \nthis from the very beginning. The number six is stamped upon the measurements of the Great Pyramid, the unit of which was the inch and its sexagesimal multiples. The first multiple is the foot, 12 inches (2x6); and after this the rises are 18 (3x6), 24 (4x6), 30 (5x6), and 36 (6x6 or 62=the yard).* * On the other hand, the sacred cubit, though not a round number, was a multiple, indeed the square of 5, being 25.3 inches. Corresponding to these measures we have the first division of the natural time-spaces which measure man's labour and rest,\u0160the day, consisting of 24 hours (4x6), divided into the day and night of 12 hours. The multiples and subdivisions are also stamped by the number six. The \nmonths being 12; while the hours consist of 60 minutes (6x10), and the minutes of 60 seconds \n(6x10). The base of the Great Pyramid shows that the unit-inch* was obtained by a division of the original circuit, 36,000 inches or 1,000 yards. * Differing from the Pyramid inch by only 1 in 40,000. On account of the curse (Gen 3), the number six tells not only of labour, but of \"labour and \nsorrow,\" and it specially marks all that is \"under the sun,\" all that is \"not of God.\" The true \n\"sabbath-keeping,\" now, is in reserve; for there is no rest apart from \"peace with God\"; the rest \nwhich God gives and which we find (Matt 11:28). But now to turn to the Scripture examples and illustrations, we note first that   CAIN'S DESCENDANTSare given only as far as the sixth generation. \n  IMPERFECTIONWhen twelve (the number of governmental perfection) is divided, it indicates imperfection in rule and administration. Solomon's throne had six steps (1 Kings 10:19), and his kingdom was \nsoon divided. The 12 loaves of the Shew Bread were divided into two sixes (Lev 24:6), and the \nTwelve Tribes were divided tribes. Abraham's six intercessions for Sodom (Gen 18) marked man's imperfection in prayer, which falls short of that of the Divine Intercessor.   THE BURNT OFFERING IN GENESIS 22is mentioned six times (vv 2,3,6,7,8,13) because the seventh was that of the Divine Substitute which God Himself would provide (v 8).   \"THE MAN OF THE EARTH.\"In Psalms 9 and 10, through which there is a running alphabetical acrostic, uniting the two Psalms, six letters of the alphabet are wanting (m to c). It is the Scripture which describes \"the \nMan of the Earth\" (Psa 10:18), the coming Anti-Christ, and the Apostasy which marks his \npresence, called the \"times of trouble\" (Psa 9:9, 10:1).   SIX EARTHQUAKESare mentioned:\u0160Exodus 19:18; 1 Kings 19:11; Amos 1:1 (Zech 14:5); Matt 27:54, 28:2; Acts 16:26.   THE SIX YEARS OF ATHALIAH'S REIGNwere six years of usurpation of the throne of David (2 Kings 11; 2 Chron 23). Athaliah slew all the seed-royal, as she thought; but God in His providence over-ruled events so that one son, \nJoash, was \"rescued from among the king's sons that were slain.\" He was hid in the house of \nGod during the six years with Jehosheba, who was shut up with him, her affections being \ncentred upon him, while Jehoiada her husband was occupied for the king, going about and \nsecuring loyal adherents by his simple repetition of Jehovah's promise, \"Behold, the king's son \nshall reign, as the LORD hath said of the sons of David\" (2 Chron 23:3). This promise was the \nsupport of the hearts of the faithful during those six years of usurpation, until the seventh year \ncame, and Joash was manifested upon his throne and all his enemies destroyed. Which things \nare a type of the King's son, even Jesus, who was rescued, by resurrection, from among the \ndead, and is now hid in the house of God on high. While He is seated and expecting, (Heb \n10:12,13), all who are \"in Christ\" are hid with Him (Col 3:3); and while, in this aspect, their \nhearts (like Jehosheba's) are occupied with the person of the King, their activities (like \nJehoiada's) are going out for Him, witnessing and testifying to the blessed truth that the King is \ncoming again and will surely reign, and the seventh year of blessing will come at last. Until that \nmoment arrives, the promise of Jehovah will be their support, that the Seed of the woman shall \nin due time crush the serpent's head (Gen 3:15).   SIX TIMES JESUS CHARGED WITH HAVING A DEVIL1.  Mark 3:22, and Matthew 12:24, \"He hath Beelzebub.\" 2.  John 7:20, \"Thou hast a devil.\" \n3.  John 8:48, \"Say we not well that...Thou hast a devil?\" \n4.  John 8:52, \"Now we know that Thou hast a devil.\" \n5.  John 10:20, \"He hath a devil, and is mad.\" \n6.  Luke 11:15, \"He casteth out devils by Beelzebub.\" This is most significant. Man's enmity to the Person of the Lord Jesus is thus branded with man's number. It will repay careful study to note the chronological order of these occasions and speakers. The very order and structure is important.   A. 1. Beelzebub, and casting out devils.B. 2. A simple charge, \"Thou hast,\" C. 3. Introduced by \"Say we not well,\" [in John 8]C. 4. Introduced by \"Now we know.\" [in John 8] B. 5. A simple charge, \"He hath.\" A. 6. Beelzebub, and casting out devils.   THE SIX-FOLD OPPOSITION TO THE WORK OF GODon the part of man is seen in the opposition to Nehemiah. It forms a lesson for all time, being \nenacted every day where any, like Nehemiah, begin a work for God. There was\u0160 1.  Grief, 2:10. 2.  Laughter, 2:19. \n3.  Wrath, indignation, and mocking, 4:1-4. \n4.  Fighting and open opposition, 4:7,8. \n5.  Conference, 6:1,2.\u0160\"Come and let us meet together.\" \"Let us take counsel together\" (v 7). This attempt was to \"weaken them from the work\" (v 9). But Nehemiah refused to \nparley with the enemies, or meet them in conference. 6.  False friends, 6:10-14.\u0160Here was the greatest danger of all. Satan, \"as an angel of light,\" seeking to mar, and hinder, and stop the work. The careful study of these six steps in man's opposition to the work of God will yield great \nspiritual profit, and arm us against the wiles of the Devil.   WORDSNow let us pass to the number, as it concerns words, and first note that there are   SIX WORDS USED FOR MANin the Bible. Four in the Old Testament, and two in the New. \n1. Md) (ad-dahm). Man as a human being (Lat. homo), having regard to his being created, and to his earthly origin. This is the word used of Messiah as the \"Son of Man.\" See a few \nexamples:\u0160 l     Gen 1:26, \"Let us make man.\" l     Gen 2:7, \"God formed man of the dust of the ground.\" l     Gen 3:24, \"So He drove out the man.\" l     Isa 2:11, \"The lofty looks of man shall be humbled.\" l     Isa 2:17, \"The loftiness of man shall be bowed down.\" l     Isa 2:9, \"The mean man boweth down.\" l     Isa 2:9, \"The great man [Ish, see next word] humbleth himself.\" l     Isa 5:15, \"The mean man shall be brought down.\" l     Isa 5:15, \"The mighty man [Ish] shall be humbled.\" l     2 Sam 7:19, \"Is this the manner of man, O LORD God?\" l     Psa 8:4, \"What is man [Enosh, see the third word] that Thou art mindful of him? and the \nson of man, that Thou visitest him?\" 2. #y) (Ish). Man, as strong and vigorous of mind and body. Man with some degree of pre-\neminence of strength and endowment. l     Zech 6:12, \"Behold the man whose name is the Branch.\" l     Psa 22:6, \"I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men [Adam, see No. 1], and \ndespised of the people.\" l     Psa 25:12, \"What man is he that feareth the LORD?\" l     Psa 39:11, \"When Thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity: surely every man is \nvanity.\" l     Psa 90 Title, \"The man of God.\" 3. #wn) (Enosh). Weak man, as mortal and subject to suffering and death; the heir of corruption. l     Psa 8:4, \"What is man that Thou art mindful of him? or the son of man\" [Adam, see No. \n1]. l     Psa 73:5, \"They are not in trouble as other men.\" l     Psa 103:15, \"As for man, his days are as grass.\" 4. rbg (Gehver), a strong man, a man of might and valour. Man as distinct from God (Job 22:2), \nand from a woman or wife (Prov 6:34). l     Zech 13:7, \"Awake, O sword, against...the man that is My fellow, saith the LORD of Hosts.\" l     Exo 10:11, \"Go now, ye that are men.\" l     Exo 12:37, \"Six hundred thousand on foot that were men.\" l     Psa 52:7, \"Lo, this is the man that made not God his strength.\" l     Jer 17:5, \"Cursed be the man that trusteth in man\" [Adam, see No. 1]. l     Jer 17:7, \"Blessed is the man that trusteth in the LORD.\" Then in the New Testament we have the two words: 5. anqrwpoV, which answers to Adam (No. 1), and 6. anhr, which answers to Ish (No. 2). It is worthy of note that these four Hebrew words are each used of the Messiah, and that the Holy Spirit has revealed a blessing for each in and through the man Christ Jesus. 1.  Md) (Adam), Psa 32:2, \"Blessed is the man unto whom the LORD imputeth not iniquity.\" 2.  #y) (Ish), Psa 1:1, \"Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.\" 3.  #wn) (Enosh), Job 5:17, \"Happy* is the man whom God correcteth, therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty.\" * The same word as in the other passages, viz., r#) (Ashrai), blessed. Lit. Oh, the blessednesses of. 4.  rbg (Gehver), Psa 94:12, \"Blessed is the man whom Thou chastenest, O LORD, and teachest him out of Thy law.\"   THE SERPENT HAS SIX NAMESThe Talmud calls attention to this fact, and gives the following:\u0160 1.  #xn (nachash), a shining one (Gen 3:1; Job 26:13. See also No. 6 below). 2.  bw#k( (ak-shoov), from #k(, \"to bend back,\" \"lie in wait.\" Translated adder, Psa 140:3. \n3.  h(p) (ephah), any poisonous serpent. Translated adder; also viper (Job 20:16; Isa 30:6, 59:5). 4.  yn(pc (tsiph-ohnee), a small hissing serpent (Isa 11:8, 59:5; Prov 23:32), from (pc, to hiss. Translated viper. 5.  Nynt (Tanneen), a great serpent, or dragon (from the root \"to stretch out\" or \"extend\"), on account of its length (Exo 7:9,10,12). 6.  Pr# (Saraph), from root \"to burn\"; a venomous, deadly serpent, from the heat and inflammation caused by its bite. Translated serpents, Num 21:8; Isa 14:29, 30:6.   THE LION HAS SIX NAMES IN THE OLD TESTAMENTand all are found in the Book of Job (Job 4:10,11 and 28:8). 1.  yr) (Aree), the roaring lion (Gen 49:9; Num 23:24, 24:9, etc.). 2.  lx# (Shachal), the fierce lion, with special reference to his voice (Job 4:10, 10:16, 28:8; Psa 91:13; Hosea 13:7). 3.  rypk (K'pheer), the young lion\u0160not a whelp as in Eze 19:2\u0160(Judg 14:5; Job 4:10, 38:39; Psa 17:12, 34:10). 4.  #yl (Lah-yish), the old lion\u0160not from age, but brave and strong\u0160(Job 4:11; Prov 30:30; Isa 30:6). 5.  )ybl (Lahvee), the old lioness (from root to roar) (Gen 49:9; Num 23:24; Deut 33:20, etc.). 6.  Cx# (Shachatz), the lion's whelps (Job 28:8, 41:34; translated \"of pride\").   SOME WORDS THAT OCCUR SIX TIMESl     Nwdb) (avad-dohn), destruction. l     +wm (moht), bar, staff, or yoke. l     Mtkm (mich-tahm), Michtam (Psa 16, 56, 57, 58, 59 and 60). This word is connected \nwith death, and at the same time with resurrection also (3x2). It is from Mtk, to cut in, engrave (LXX, sthlografia, a sculptured writing; sthlh was the word for grave-stone). Hence \"Michtam,\" like our \"Resurgam,\" indicates that these six Psalms, though \nconnected with death, point to the hope of resurrection. This is notably true of Psalm 16, \nand may be traced in the others also. l     aiscunh (aischunee), shame. l     allattw (allatto), to change. l     asebeia (asebeia), ungodliness. l     atimazw (atimazo), entreat shamefully. l     bdelugma (bdelugma), abomination. Three in Gospels: Matt 24:15; Mark 13:14; Luke \n16:15. Three in Revelation: Rev 17:4, 5, 21:27. For the combinations of 6, 66, and 666, see further under the number Six hundred and sixty six.   ADDITIONAL MISCELLANEOUS ILLUSTRATIONSSix times our Lord was asked for a sign:\u0160 1.  The Pharisees, Matt 12:38; Mark 8:11. 2.  The Sadducees, Matt 16:1. 3.  The Disciples, Matt 24:3; Mark 13:4. \n4.  The people, Luke 11:16. \n5.  The Jews, John 2:18. \n6.  The people, John 6:30. Six persons bore testimony to the Saviour's innocency:\u0160 1.  Pilate, Luke 23:14. \n2.  Herod, Luke 23:15. \n3.  Judas, Matt 27:3. \n4.  Pilate's wife, Matt 27:19. \n5.  The dying thief, Luke 23:41. \n6.  The centurion, Luke 23:47.   Back | Contents | Next  Back | Contents | Next PART II ITS SPIRITUAL SIGNIFICANCE SEVENWe come now to the great number of spiritual perfection. A number which, therefore, occupies so large a place in the works, and especially in the Word of God as being inspired by the Holy \nSpirit. In the first part of this book we have enlarged somewhat on the importance of this number in Nature and in Grace, so that we need not here repeat many of the interesting facts already given. As a number the actual word and number \"SEVEN\" is used as no other number is. Seven and its compounds occur in multiples of seven in the Old Testament. Seven occurs 287 times, or 7 x 41. \"Seventh,\" the fractional part, occurs 98 times, or 7 x 14. \n\"Seven-fold,\" occurs 7 times. The above three numbers together are of course a multiple of seven, but a very remarkable one, 287 + 98 + 7 = 392, and 392 is 72 + 73, or 8 times the square of seven (72x8). Then again seven, in combination with other numbers, is remarkable, such as fifty and seven, a hundred and seven, etc. There are 112 of these combinations, or 7 x 16. \"Seventy\" occurs 56 times, or 7 x 8. \"Seventy,\" in combination with other numbers, occurs 35 times, or 7 x 5. \nIt is, however, when we come to consider its significance that the true glories of its spiritual perfection are revealed. We have just seen that six is the number which is stamped upon all things human, as being emphatically the number of man. Let us first observe the use of the two numbers.   SIX AND SEVEN TOGETHERas combining and contrasting what is human and what is spiritual. A remarkable illustration of this is seen in   THE TWO GENEALOGIES OF JESUS CHRISTNote, first, in which two of the four Gospels they are found, for this is also significant. l     In Matthew God says to us, \"Behold thy King\" (Zech 9:9). l     In Mark He says, \"Behold My Servant\" (Isa 40:1). l     In Luke He says, \"Behold the Man\" (Zech 6:12). l     In John He says, \"Behold your God\" (Isa 40:9). Now a servant need not produce his genealogy; neither can God have one. It is a King who must have one, and a Man who should have one. Therefore it is that we have two genealogies, and not \nmore than two. And that is why we have one in Matthew giving the Royal genealogy of Jesus as \nKing; and one in Luke giving the Human genealogy of Jesus as Man. Hence also it is that \nMatthew's is a descending genealogy, while Luke's is an ascending one. For kings must trace \ntheir descent, all power in the world being derived from God, who says, \"By Me kings reign\": \nand man must trace his ascent to some particular ancestor. Matthew's, therefore, begins with \nAbraham, and comes down to Joseph, the son of Heli; while Luke's starts from Joseph, and goes \nup to Adam and God. As far as David both the lists agree. But here an important divergence takes place. In Matthew, after David, we have his son Solomon; while in Luke we have another son, Solomon's elder \nbrother, Nathan. From this point, therefore, we have two lines. One (Matthew) gives the royal \nand legal line through Solomon; the other (Luke) gives the natural and lineal line through \nNathan. The former is the line according to legal succession; the latter is the line according to \nnatural descent. The former was the result of the will of God in choosing Solomon, a younger \nson; while the latter was the result of the will of man, and in the order of human birth. Both lines \nmeet in Joseph, the son of Jacob by birth, and the son of Heli by marriage with Mary, Heli's only \ndaughter.* Thus the two lines are united and exhausted in Jesus Christ; for by His death they \nboth became extinct, and thus He was the King of Israel by right; became, and was declared to \nbe, the Son of God by resurrection from the dead (Rom 1:4; Psa 2:7; Acts 13:33 and Heb 1:5, \n5:5). * This is supported by the true reading of Luke 3:23, which, according to Lachmann, \nTischendorf, Tregelles, Alford, Westcott and Hort, and the RV, should read, \"Jesus \nwhen He began to teach was about thirty years of age, being the son, as was supposed, of Joseph, the son of Heli.\" The verb nouizw (nomizo) means to lay down a thing as law, to hold by custom, or usage, to own as a custom, to take for granted. Here it \nrefers not to any supposition as to Jesus being Joseph's son, but to the legal sanction \nand customary practice which reckoned Joseph as Heli's son through marriage with his \ndaughter Mary. See Ruth 1:11-13, where Ruth by marriage with Naomi's son was called her daughter; Nehemiah 7:63, where Hakkoz by marriage with Barzillai's daughter was \"called after their name\"; and Numbers 36, where the daughters of \nZelophehad, by Divine counsel, \"were married to their father's brothers' sons...and \ntheir inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father\" (vv 11,12). This is \nexactly what took place with Mary, who, according to the Jerusalem Talmud (Chag. \n77,4), is called the daughter of Heli, and by her marriage with Joseph, who was the real son of Jacob, caused Joseph to be called, according to custom (nomizw), the son, or rather son-in-law, of Heli. Now the wonderful fact is that we have in the genealogy of Luke 3 exactly 77 names, with GOD at the one end, and JESUS at the other. This is indeed stamping it with the number of spiritual \nperfection. On the other hand, although the genealogy in Matthew is artificially constructed (according to a recognised custom amongst the Jews, instances of which we have in the Old Testament), it is so \narranged that it contains 42 generations, or SIX sevens (6x7). These 42 generations contain\u0160 Forty-one* names that are named in Matt 1 41Four which are omitted* 4If we add the twenty-one names before Abraham (from Luke 3) 21We have in the royal line through Solomon 66* There are only 41 names:\u0160Jechonias being given at the end of the second list, and \nrepeated at the beginning of the third. There are three divisions (the stamp of Divine \nperfection), with 14 names in the first, 14 names in the second, but with 13 names in \nthe third. For the significance of this, see under the number thirteen, marking Jesus as \nthe Saviour who was made sin for His people.These three divisions are in themselves remarkable. The first ends with the happy condition of the people under David; the second with ruin; the third with the Saviour. The first begins with Abraham, the recipient of the unconditional covenant of the Land (Gen 15), and ends with David, the recipient of the unconditional covenant of the \nThrone (2 Sam 7). The second begins with Solomon, and ends with the Captivity; i.e., \nwith the building of the Temple at the one end, and the destruction of it at the other. \nThe third begins with the Captivity, the promise of the Messiah through Daniel (chap. \n9), and ends with His birth in the person of Jesus. ** The four names omitted are the three immediate successors of Jehoram, between Jehoram and Uzziah. 1.  Ahaziah, or Jehoahaz, 2 Kings 8:29-10:27; 2 Chron 22:39. 2.  Joash, 2 Kings 11:2-12:20; 2 Chron 24:1-25. 3.  Amaziah (or Ahimaaz), 2 Kings 14:8-20; 2 Chron 25:7-27. And one between Josiah and Jeconiah, viz.\u0160 4.  Jehoiakim, 2 Kings 23:36-24:6; 2 Chron 36:5-8. It was he who cut to pieces and burnt the roll which contained the words of Jehovah (Jer 36:23). The \nTalmud says that the reason why his name is not mentioned generally in the \ngenealogies is because it was said concerning him (2 Chron 36:8), \"And the \nrest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and the abominations which he did, and that \nwhich was found ON HIM.\" Rabbi Jochanan says it means that \"he caused an \nimage to be engraved on his body.\" He was \"Childless\" as to the throne; for \nthough he had seven sons (1 Chron 3:17,18), it was his grandson Zerubbabel \nwho became ruler over Israel (2 Kings 25:29,30). So that while Jesus is the 77th name in the line which comes through Nathan, it is the 66th name \nin the line which comes through Solomon. When we remember that six is the human number, and seven the Divine, can we doubt that we are thus pointed to the fact that Jesus was both Son of God and Son of Man? His two names have the same significant stamp and seal: for 'IhsouV, JESUS, the birth name of His humiliation as Man, is composed of six letters; while CristoV, Christ, His Divine title as the Anointed of God, is composed of seven letters. On carefully comparing the two genealogies again, we find that certain names are common to both lines. Of these there are exactly 36, or 6 x 6, i.e., the square of 6 (62). The names to David* 34 namesSalathiel and Zerubbabel 2 names  36 names* The names actually named as common to both are 16 (42); viz., from Abraham to David are 14; Zerubbabel and Salathiel, 2. Here we have a marvelous interlacing and combination of the numbers six and seven, which \nserve to stamp both genealogies with the Spirit's seal, and to set forth the human and Divine \nnatures of Jesus our Lord, as perfect Man and perfect God. We give the following complete list:\u0160 Matthew Matthew and Luke Names in common LukeGODAdam\nSeth\nEnos    CainanMaleleel\nJared\nEnoch\nMathusala\nLamech\nNoe\nSem\nArphaxad\nCainan\nSala\nHeber\nPhalec\nRagau\nSaruch\nNachor\nThara  Abraham  Isaac\nJacob\nJudas\nPhares\nEsrom\nAram (or Ram)\nAminadab\nNaasson\nSalmon\nBooz\nObed\nJesse\nDAVIDSOLOMON NATHANRoboam MattathaAbiah MenanAsa Melea  Josaphat Eliakim Joram Jonan (Menani)[Ahaziah or Jehoahaz] Joseph[Joash] Juda[Amaziah] SimeonOzias (or Uzziah) LeviJoatham MatthatAchaz (or Ahaz) JorimEzekias (or \nHezekiah) EliezerManasses JoseAmon ErJosias Elmodam[Jehoiakim] CosamJechonias Addi  MelchiNeri  Salathiel or Shealtiel (the real son of \nJechonias, \nthe legal son of Neri)  Zorobabel \n(the real son of Pedaiah, \n1 Chron 3:19, \nthe legal son of Salathiel, \nDeut 25:5)Abiud   RhesaEliakim JoannaAzor JudaSadoc JosephAchim SemeiEliud MattathiasEleazar MaathMatthan NaggeJacob EsliJOSEPH (the real \nson of Jacob) Naum  AmosMattathias\nJoseph\nJanna\nMelchi\nLevi\nMatthat\nHeli\nJOSEPH (the legal \nson of Heli)* JESUS CHRIST* See note, pp. 159, 160. Joseph was the husband of Mary, \"of whom was born Jesus which is called Christ\" (Matt 1:16). \nThat is to say, Joseph, who was the real son of Jacob (for it says \"Jacob BEGAT Joseph,\" Matt \n1:16), could become the legal son of Heli only by his marriage with Heli's daughter Mary. \nHence it does not say, in Luke 3:23, that Heli begat Joseph, but that he was \"the son of Heli.\" \nThe words, \"the son,\" it will be observed, are in italics, and being thus a wider expression, \ndenotes that he was legally the son-in-law of Heli, by his marriage with Mary, Heli's real \ndaughter. While Jesus, therefore, was the real son of Mary, He could be reckoned as the legal son of Joseph, and was descended from Nathan through Heli, as well as from Solomon through Jacob. The number six is further associated with Christ as the Son of Man, in that His birth was announced in the sixth month (Luke 1:26): and the sixth hour is specially marked at His \ncrucifixion (Matt 27:45; Mark 15:33; Luke 23:44).   THE SONS OF GODBeni-ha-Elohim, \"sons of God,\" occurs six times:\u0160 1.  Genesis 6:2 2.  Job 2:6 \n3.  Job 38:7 \n4.  Psalm 29:1 \n5.  Psalm 89:6 \n6.  Daniel 3:25 Beni-El-hai, \"sons of the living God,\" once:\u0160 7.  Hosea 1:10 Seven times in all, but not seven exactly alike. There are six in one form (used of angels), and one in another (used of men), to mark the fact that the sons of God, whether angels or men, fell \nfrom the spiritual perfection of their original position. This interesting illustration is not the only example of the contrasts presented between these two numbers, six and seven. Mr. Samuell* instances others:\u0160 * Seven the Sacred Number, by Richard Samuell, p. 438.   SHEM, HAM, AND JAPHETHThe two names Shem and Japheth, who received their father's blessing, occur together seven \ntimes; but six of these are in connection with Ham whose posterity was cursed!   THE FOOD OF EGYPTis given in six items (Num 11:5), viz., fish, cucumbers, melons, leeks, onions, and garlick; whereas the enumeration of the Divine provision of Emmanuel's land is marked by the number \nseven (Deut 8:8),\u0160wheat, barley, vines, fig-trees, pomegranates, olives, and honey.   ISRAEL'S LOVERSare represented as giving to her six things (Hosea 2:5),\u0160bread, water, wool, flax, oil, and drink; while Jehovah speaks of His own precious gifts of love to His people by contrast as being seven \nin number (vv 8,9),\u0160corn, wine, oil, silver, gold, wool, and flax.   THE DAYS OF CREATION AND RESTIn the Creation we have the six days and the seven. The six of labour and the seventh of rest. \n  THE TWO LANDS2 Kings 18:32: Rabshakeh, in describing the land to which he would take the people captive, enumerated six things; but as he mentions them as being like their own land, there are seven as \nwell: \"A land like your own \nland, 7a land of corn 6and wine,a land of breadand vineyards,a land of oil oliveand of honey.\"  THE DOMINION OF MANPsalm 8:6-8: Six sets forth the perfection of human authority, and seven marks the fact that the \nsix defined particulars were of Divine gift: \"Thou hast put all things under his feet: 7all sheep 6and oxen,yea, and the beasts of the field;\nthe fowl of the air,\nand the fish of the sea,\nand whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas.\"  THE SEVEN SPIRITSIsaiah 11:2: Six here marking that Christ would be perfect man, and seven that He was perfect God; the first statement being marked off from the rest by its form:\u0160 \"The Spirit of the LORD shall rest upon \nHim, the Spirit of wisdom 76and understanding,the Spirit of counsel\nand might,\nthe Spirit of knowledge\nand of the fear of the LORD.\"  THE SPIRIT POURED OUTJoel 2:28, 29: The \"all flesh\" is the Divine inclusion; but six particulars mark the definition. It need hardly be added that this blessing refers (by interpretation) only to the house of Israel. \"I will pour out My spirit upon all flesh7and your sons 6 and your daughters shall prophesy,your old men shall dream dreams,\nyour young men shall see visions;\nand also upon the servants,\nand upon the handmaids, will I pour out My spirit.\"  ISRAEL'S ENDOWMENTSRomans 9:4: The one defining who they were by Divine calling and standing, the six setting forth what pertained to them as men, thus called and blessed:\u0160 \"Who are Israelites; 7To whom pertaineth the \nadoption, 6and the glory,and the covenants,\nand the giving of the law,\nand the service [of God],\nand the promises  THE GOLDEN CANDLESTICKhad six branches out of one central stem, making seven in all, marking, and in harmony with, the fact, that the light was the light of God's people in the world, but that its source was Divine.   THE PANOPLY OF GODIn Ephesians 6:14-18, the Christian's panoply consists of six pieces; but there is a seventh without which they are of no avail, and that is \"the Spear,\" which is Prayer:\u0160 l     The Girdle of Truth, John 14:6, 17:17. l     The Breastplate of Righteousness, Jer 23:6; Phil 3:9. l     The Sandals of the Gospel, Eph 2:10. l     The Shield of Faith (i.e., Faith's shield, which is Christ), Gen 17:1; Rom 13:14; Psa \n91:4. l     The Sword of the Spirit (i.e., the Spirit's sword, which is the Word of God), Rev 19:13. l     Prayer\u0160which keeps the armour bright and enables us to use it effectually.   EZEKIEL'S TEMPLEIn Ezekiel 40 the measurements of God's Temple are given, which is yet to be erected in His \nland. The measuring rod used by \"the man\" was \"six great cubits\" in length (41:8). But the great \ncubit was one cubit and a hand-breadth long (40:5, RV); therefore as six hand-breadths went to \none cubit, there were really seven ordinary cubits in \"the full reed of six great cubits.\" Thus whenever six and seven are used together the difference between their respective significations is most marked.   SEVEN, BY ITSELFBut now turning to the number Seven, we must first consider the meaning of the word. \nIn the Hebrew, seven is (ba#$e (shevah). It is from the root (ba#$&af (savah), to be full or satisfied, have enough of. Hence the meaning of the word \"seven\" is dominated by this root, for \non the seventh day God rested from the work of Creation. It was full and complete, and good \nand perfect. Nothing could be added to it or taken from it without marring it. Hence the word \ntba#$af (Shavath), to cease, desist, rest, and tb@af#$a Shabbath, Sabbath, or day of rest. This root runs through various languages; e.g., Sanscrit, saptan; Zend., hapta; Greek, epta (hepta); Latin, septem. All these preserve the \"t,\" which in the Semitic and Teutonic languages is \ndropped out; e.g. Gothic, sibun; Germ., sieben; Eng., seven. It is seven, therefore, that stamps with perfection and completeness that in connection with which it is used. Of time, it tells of the Sabbath, and marks off the week of seven days, which, \nartificial as it may seem to be, is universal and immemorial in its observance amongst all nations \nand in all times. It tells of that eternal Sabbath-keeping which remains for the people of God in \nall its everlasting perfection. In the creative works of God, seven completes the colours of the spectrum and rainbow, and satisfies in music the notes of the scale. In each of these the eighth is only a repetition of the \nfirst. Another meaning of the root (ba#$af (Shavagh) is to swear, or make an oath. It is clear from its first occurrence in Genesis 21:31, \"They sware both of them,\" that this oath was based upon the \n\"seven ewe lambs\" (vv 28,29,30), which point to the idea of satisfaction or fulness in an oath. It \nwas the security, satisfaction, and fulness of the obligation, or completeness of the bond, which \ncaused the same word to be used for both the number seven and an oath; and hence it is written, \n\"an oath for confirmation is an end of all strife.\" Beer-sheba, the well of the oath, is the standing \nwitness of the spiritual perfection of the number seven. The number meets us on   THE FORE-FRONT OF REVELATIONThe first statement as to the original Creation in Genesis 1:1 consists of 7 words, and 28 letters (4x7).* * But we ought to note in passing that the next statement, Genesis 1:2, which tells of \nthe ruin into which this Creation fell, though it consists of 14 words, yet it has 52 \nletters. Now 52 is 4 times 13, and 13, as we shall see further on, is the number of \napostasy. Thus the cause of that ruin is more than intimated by the number 13 appearing so significantly in the second verse. THE WORDS OF JEHOVAHare pure words. They are not angelic words (2 Cor 12:4; 1 Cor 13:1), not words pertaining to heaven; but words used by men on this earth, human words, and therefore they have to be \nperfectly purified, as silver is purified in a furnace. In Psalm 12:6, there is an ellipsis which \nrequires the word \"words\" to be repeated from the previous clause. Then we can take the \npreposition l, (Lamed), which means \"to,\" in its natural sense. The AV translates it of (\"a furnace \nof earth\"); and the RV renders it on (\"a furnace on the earth\"). Both are wrong through not \nseeing and supplying the ellipsis which would have enabled them to translate the l to, or \npertaining to, literally. Thus:\u0160 a. The words of Jehovah are pure words,b. As silver tried in a furnace: a. [Words] pertaining to the earth, b. Purified seven times.Here we have the four lines complete, in which \"a\" corresponds to \"a,\" the subject being the words of Jehovah. While in \"b\" and \"b\" we have the purifying: in \"b\" of silver, and in \"b\" of the \nearthly words which Jehovah uses. Jehovah takes up and uses words \"pertaining to this world,\" but they require purifying. Some words He does not use at all; some He uses with a higher meaning; others He uses with a new \nmeaning: thus they are purified. Now, silver is refined \"seven times.\" So these words have to be \nperfectly purified before they can be used as \"the words of Jehovah.\"   ABRAHAM'S SEVEN-FOLD BLESSINGin Genesis 12:2, 3:\u0160 \"I will make of thee a great nation, And I will bless thee, \nAnd make thy name great; \nAnd thou shalt be a blessing; \nAnd I will bless them that bless thee, \nAnd curse him that curseth thee: \nAnd in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.\" With this we may compare   JEHOVAH'S SEVEN-FOLD COVENANT WITH ISRAELin Exodus 6:6-8. Seven times does the expression, \"I will\" occur in these few verses, stamping the whole with spiritual perfection. These are preceded by \"I have\" three times repeated (vv \n4,5), giving the Divine basis on which the blessing was based:\u0160 I have established My covenant with them, etc. \nI have also heard their groaning, etc. \nI have remembered My covenant. Then follows the seven-fold blessing:\u0160 I will bring you out from Egypt. \nI will rid you of their bondage. \nI will redeem you. I will take you to Me for a people. I will be to you a God. \nI will bring you in unto the land. \nI will give it you.   \"NOW HEBRON WAS BUILT SEVEN YEARS BEFORE ZOAN IN EGYPT\"(Num 13:22). Egypt was \"the house of bondage.\" Zoan was that city in it where its wise men \nwere shown to be fools (Isa 19:11-13). It was also the place where God's miracles were \nperformed which brought out the folly of that human wisdom (Psa 78:12,43). But Hebron, which means fellowship, was a place in Canaan, the city of Abraham, \"the friend of God,\" still called today the city of El Khulil, \"of the Friend.\" In its valley, Eschol, grew the \nfinest fruit of Emmanuel's land. \"Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.\" This phrase, thrown in parenthetically, at the moment when His people first discovered the existence of Hebron, \ncontains the intimation of a deep spiritual truth, as shown by the significance of the number \nseven. It shows that the sphere of Divine friendship and fellowship and of heavenly delights was established in eternity, seven years marking the spiritual perfection of time, before the wisdom \nof this world had any existence or place. (See Psa 90:2, 103:17; Prov 8:22-31; Micah 5:2; John \n17:5-24; 1 Cor 2:7; Eph 1:4-3:11; 2 Tim 1:9: Titus 1:2; 1 Peter 1:19,20).   THE SEVEN-FOLD SPRINKLINGimplies that it was perfectly and spiritually efficacious. \nOn the great Day of Atonement the blood was sprinkled \"ON the mercy-seat eastward.\" This was Godward, and therefore it was once done and on the mercy-seat. But \"BEFORE the mercy-\nseat\" it was to be sprinkled seven times. Before* the mercy-seat seven times, because this was \nthe perfect testimony for the people that the atonement for their sins was accomplished. * It was \"directly before the Tabernacle\" that the blood of the red heifer was sprinkled \nseven times, Numbers 19:4. The leper also was cleansed in the same place with a seven-fold sprinkling of the blood of the killed bird (Lev 14:7,11). The directions for the Day of Atonement are given in Leviticus 16; but from other Scriptures we learn that there were seven sprinklings on that great day, to mark the perfection of accomplished \natonement:\u0160 1.  On the mercy-seat (Lev 16:14). 2.  Before the mercy-seat (Lev 16:14). \n3.  Before the veil (Lev 4:17). \n4.  On the horns of the golden altar (Exo 30:10). \n5.  On the horns of the brazen altar (Lev 16:18). \n6.  Round about upon the altar (Lev 16:19). \n7.  The blood that was left poured out at the foot of the brazen altar (Lev 4:18).   THE PSALMSare in many ways stamped with this number of spiritual perfection. There are 126 Psalms which have titles. That is 7 x 18. There are seven names mentioned in the titles as the authors of these Psalms, viz.:\u0160 1.  David, 56 (7x8). 2.  The Sons of Korah, 11 (Psa 42, 44-49, 84, 85, 87, 88). \n3.  Asaph, 12 (Psa 50, 73-83). \n4.  Heman the Ezrahite, 1 (Psa 88). \n5.  Ethan the Ezrahite, 1 (Psa 89). \n6.  Moses, 1 (Psa 90). \n7.  Solomon, 1 (Psa 72). There were 14 Psalms (2x7), all David's, which were written on historical occasions; viz., Psalm \n3, 7, 18, 30, 34, 51, 52, 54, 56, 57, 59, 60, 63, and 142. Seven Psalms are ascribed to David in the New Testament,specifically, by name:\u0160: 1.  Psalm 2 in Acts 4:25, \"Who by the mouth of Thy servant DAVID hast said, Why did the heathen rage and the people imagine a vain thing.\" 2.  Psalm 16 in Acts 2:25, \"For DAVID speaketh concerning Him, I foresaw the LORD always before my face, for He is on my right hand that I should not be moved.\" 3.  Psalm 32 in Romans 4:6, \"Even as DAVID also describeth the blessedness of the man unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works.\" 4.  Psalm 41 in Acts 1:16, \"This Scripture must needs have been fulfilled which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of DAVID spake before concerning Judas.\" 5.  Psalm 69 in Romans 11:9, \"And DAVID saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumbling-block, and a recompence unto them.\" 6.  Psalm 95 in Hebrews 4:7, \"He limiteth a certain day, saying in DAVID, Today, after so long a time, as it is said, Today if ye will hear His voice.\" 7.  Psalm 109 in Matthew 22:43, \"How then doth DAVID in spirit call him Lord, saying, The LORD said unto my Lord,\" etc. It will be observed that these seven quotations are arranged like the golden candlestick, in 2 threes with one in the centre, viz.:\u0160 3 in the Acts \n1 in the Gospels, and \n3 in the Epistles; Or, like the candlestick\u0160 GOSPEL Matt 23:43Acts 1:16 ----- \u00a6 ----- Rom 4:6Acts 2:25 -------- \u00a6 -------- Rom 11:9Acts 4:25 ----------- \u00a6 ------------ Heb 4:7  \u00a6  The Seven Quotations from Psalm 69 in New Testamentshow that this Psalm is one of great importance, and mark its spiritual perfection, in connection \nwith the Lord Jesus. 1.  Verse 4. The Lord Himself quotes this when the Eleven are gathered round Him just after the institution of the Supper, after telling them to expect the hatred of the world, \nbecause He had chosen them out of it. John 15:18-25. 2.  Verse 9. Again, concerning the Lord, His disciples remembered that it was written. John 2:13-17. 3.  Verse 9. The Holy Spirit uses it to hold up Christ as a pattern, even as Christ pleased not Himself. Romans 15:3. 4.  Verse 21. At the crucifixion this was fulfilled. Matthew 27:34, 48. \n5.  Verses 22 and 23. The Holy Spirit, referring to the fact that Israel had not obtained that which it sought for, but only the elect remnant, the rest being blinded, says Romans \n11:7-10. 6.  Verses 24 and 27. Referring to the persecution of Christians by the Jews, the Holy Spirit says 1 Thessalonians 2:15, 16. 7.  Verses 25 and 27. The Lord, in His last denunciation, closing His testimony against Jerusalem, says Matthew 23:29-38. This seven is divided into the usual four and three; four of the quotations being in the Gospels, \nand three being in the Epistles. Further, they occur in the first and last of the Gospels, and in the \nfirst and last of the Epistles written to Churches. Thus they are stamped by the number of \nspiritual perfection. In Matthew 2 4 in the \nGospels 7In John 2In Romans 2 3 in the EpistlesIn Thessalonians 1  \"MAN OF GOD\"There are seven so-called in the Old Testament:\u0160 l     Moses, Deut 33:1, and 5 other times. l     David, 2 Chron 8:14, and twice. l     Samuel, 1 Sam 9:6, and 3 times. l     Shemaiah, 1 Kings 12:22, and once (2 Chron 11:2). l     Elijah, 7 times. l     Elisha, 2 Kings 4:7, and 29 times. l     Igdaliah, once, Jer 35:4. One in the New Testament on Resurrection ground (Timothy), making eight altogether.   SEVEN WEAK THINGS IN JUDGES,used by God as instruments of deliverance, marking and stamping the spiritual perfection of His work:\u0160 1.  A left handed man (3:21),\u0160Ehud delivering from Moab's oppression. \n2.  An ox-goad (3:31) in the hand of Shamgar, delivering from the Philistines. \n3.  A woman (4:4), and \n4.  A tent-peg in the hand of Jael (4:21) [delivering from Jabin, king of Canaan]. \n5.  A piece of a millstone (9:53), thrown by another woman, and delivering the people from Abimelech's usurpation. 6.  The pitchers and trumpets of Gideon's 300 (7:20), delivering from the hosts of Midian. \n7.  The jaw-bone of an ass (15:16), by which Samson delivered Israel from the Philistines. And why all this in connection with the \"saviour\" (2:16-18), whom God raised up and used? To \nshow that \"no flesh shall glory in His presence\" (1 Cor 1:20). So in later times, whenever God has \"done wondrously,\" He has chosen \"the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty\" (1 Cor 1:27). It was so in Apostolic days, and \nhas been so in all ages. It was Luther, a miner's son, by whom God \"shook the world.\" It was \nCalvin, a cooper's son in Picardy, by whom God built up His church in the Faith. It was Zwingle, \na shepherd's son in the Alps, by whom God established the Reformation in Switzerland. It was \nJohn Knox, the son of a plain burgess in a country town, who caused Scotland to be known as \"the Land of Knox.\" And so through all the ages God has made it clear that it is He who is the worker, and that the instruments He chooses to use are nothing. He usually rejected man's firstborn, and chose a \nyounger son. He took David, the youngest, from the sheepfold, to be ruler over His people, as \nHe had chosen Gideon, the least member of the poorest family in Manasseh, to deliver Israel \nfrom the Midianite hosts.   SEVEN-FOLD QUALIFICATION FOR SERVICEThis is seen in Gideon, Judges 6. 1.  Conviction as to his own humiliating condition, verse 11, as shown in verse 15. 2.  An exercised heart, verse 13, as caused probably by the prophet's testimony, verse 8. \n3.  No confidence in the flesh, verse 15. \n4.  Peace with God through grace; the peace of God through gift, verses 17, 18, 22, 23. \n5.  Worship, verse 24. \n6.  Obedience in small things, verses 25-27. \n7.  Power for great things, verses 33-35 and chapter 7. A careful study of Judges 6 will yield spiritual profit, instructing us as to the ways of God in \ncalling and qualifying His servants.     SEVEN OAK TREESare mentioned in the Old Testament; the seven being divided into four and three\u0160the first three being connected with burial. l     Genesis 35:4. Jacob buried teraphim. l     Genesis 35:8. Rachel's nurse. l     2 Samuel 31:13. At Jabesh Saul and his sons buried. l     Joshua 24:26. Joshua set up the stones of witness. l     2 Samuel 18:9. Absalom's oak. l     Judges 6:11. At Ophrah, where the angel appeared. l     1 Kings 13:14. Where the man of God sat.   SEVEN OF JESSE'S SONSpassed before Samuel (1 Sam 16) to show that the perfection of nature can yield nothing for \nGod.   SEVEN MIRACLES IN JOHN'S GOSPELl     2. The water turned into wine. l     4:47. The nobleman's son. l     5:4. At the pool of Bethesda. l     6. The feeding of the 5,000. l     9:1. The man born blind. l     11. The raising of Lazarus. l     21. The draught of fishes. These formed the spiritual perfection of the \"signs\" that Jesus was the Christ.   THE SEVEN WORDS TO THE WOMAN OF SAMARIAin John 4 are full of interest, and the perfection of Christ's dealings with her is thus stamped. 1.  4:7. Attracting her attention by His question, \"Give Me to drink?\" 2.  4:10. Leading her to ask it of Him. \n3.  4:13,14. Describing the water which He gives. \n4.  4:16. The arrow of conviction, \"Go,\" \"call,\" and \"come.\" \n5.  4:17. Increasing the conviction. \n6.  4:21-24. Answering her questions and her doubts. \n7.  4:26. Revealing Himself. THE SEVEN APPEARANCES OF ANGELS** There were three appearances before the birth of Jesus:\u0160(1) to Zacharias (Luke \n1:1); (2) to Mary (Luke 1:26); (3) to Joseph (Matt 1:20). Altogether there were ten, \nwhich completes the perfection of Divine order. It would prove a fruitful source of profit to make a close study of all the words and sayings of angels. during the life of Jesus on earth. 1.  To the shepherds (Luke 2:9). 2.  To Joseph (Matt 2:13). \n3.  To Joseph (Matt 2:19). \n4.  After the Temptation (Matt 4:11). \n5.  In Gethsemane (Luke 22:43). \n6.  At the Resurrection (Matt 28:2). \n7.  At the Ascension (Acts 1:10).   THE SEVEN THINGS WHICH SPIRITUALLY DEFILEThey come \"out of the heart,\" and complete the picture of spiritual defilement, emphasising the fact that spiritual defilement is caused, not by that which goeth \"into the mouth,\" but by that \nwhich cometh \"out of the heart\" (Matt 15:19). There is no end to the mere enumeration of the groups of seven things which are to be found in the Bible. Many students have noted them, and some have published lists of their discoveries. \nThis part of our subject is so well-known and well-trodden, that we may here leave it, merely \nnoting a few miscellaneous examples. Mr. Samuell points out some curious facts in connection \nwith   THE TEN COMMANDMENTSThese were written with the finger of God, and would, therefore, be specially stamped with this symbol of spiritual perfection. 1.  Seven of them commence with the word )l, not. \n2.  The word Mwy, day, occurs seven times. \n3.  The preposition b, in, seven times. \n4.  The preposition l, to, 14 times. \n5.  \"Upon\" and \"above\" together, seven times. \n6.  \"Serve,\" \"servant,\" \"maidservant,\" together, seven times. \n7.  The relationship of \"father,\" \"mother,\" \"son,\" \"daughter,\" \"wife,\" together, seven times. \n8.  The numbers \"third,\" \"fourth,\" \"six,\" \"seventh,\" and \"thousands,\" together, seven times. \n9.  \"Lord\" and \"God,\" together, 14 times. 10.  There are seven different pronouns used, in all 49 times (72)* * Omitting \"thy\" before \"stranger\" (Commandment 4) with LXX and Vulgate. 11.  The 3rd person singular pronoun occurs seven times. 12.  The conjunction \"and\" seven times in Commandment 2. \n13.  The definite article seven times in Commandment 4. \n14.  Commandment 4 forbids the doing of any work on the seventh day to seven persons and things. 15.  Commandment 10 forbids coveting to seven persons and things. \n16.  Commandment 3 contains 21 (7x3) simple words. \n17.  Commandment 9 contains 7; and \n18.  Commandment 10 contains 28 (7x4).   THE DIVISION OF SEVEN INTO FOUR AND THREEis generally noticeable. It is specially so in the Apocalypse. The Promises to the Churchesare seven in number. Each contains the solemn exhortation, \"He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.\" In the first three epistles the promise (which refers to \nthe past in its imagery) follows this exhortation; while in the latter four the promise (which has \nreference to future blessings) precedes it. Our attention is thus called to this great exhortation. It tells us that when these epistles were sent, the Church and the churches had all failed in their corporate capacity. They are addressed not to \nthe churches, but to individuals; and all through, individuals are exhorted. It is the same with \nJohn's Epistles, written, like his Gospel and the Apocalypse, at the close of the first century. So \nthat we must not and cannot do as we are bidden on every hand,\u0160\"Go back to the first three \ncenturies,\" and \"hear the voice of the Church\"; for before the close of the first century we are \nbidden to hear not what the church or the churches say, but to \"hear what the Spirit saith unto \nthe churches.\" The Seven Sealsare thus divided; the first four being marked by the command \"Come,\"* given to the horseman, \nwhile the latter three are altogether different. * The verb means \"to come,\" or \"go.\" The Seven Trumpetsare also divided into three and four, the first four being severed from the latter three by the angel \nflying saying, \"Woe, woe, woe.\" The Seven Parables of Matthew 13are also thus marked, as already shown on page 128. The division is still further marked by the three commencing with the word \"Again\" (vv 44, 45, \nand 47), while the four are separated by the word \"Another\"; thus indicating that in the four we \nhave four different revelations in their relation to the world, while in the three we have a \nrepetition of the one truth in different forms in its relation to God's people.

The \"seventh\" man \"from Adam\" \"was not, for God took him\" (Gen 5:24). The day of atonement was in the seventh month (Lev 16:29). The clean beasts were taken into the Ark by sevens (Gen 7:2). (The others were taken by twos, 6:19). Seven steps lead up to the temple in Ezekiel 40. \nThe Lord's Prayer contains seven petitions. These are divided into four and three. The first three relate to God, the four to man. Seven washings are typical of our complete spiritual cleansing (2 Kings 5:14).   NUMBERS OF WORDS AND OCCURRENCESTurning now to another department we come to a large subject, which has already been touched upon (see chapter 2). Some writers see seven everywhere and in everything in the Bible. But this is to deny, \npractically, the significance of all other numbers, and to lose all their instruction. Still we must \nadmit that in the structure and outward form of Holy Writ, as being the special work of the Holy \nSpirit, we do see this stamp of spiritual perfection in a very remarkable manner. Mr. Samuell \ncalls attention to the number as we see it: 1.  In the occurrences of single words. \n2.  In the occurrences of important phrases. \n3.  In groups of words from the same root. \n4.  In groups of words from different roots, but with similar meaning. And this not merely in the Bible as a whole, but sometimes very markedly: 1.  In the Old Testament. \n2.  In the Hebrew or Chaldee portions of the Old Testament. \n3.  In the New Testament. \n4.  In a particular book. \n5.  In all the books of a particular writer. \n6.  In a particular section of a book referring to a special subject. Let us look at a few examples, and first of the number of words used for a particular thing. We \nhave already seen an example of this under the number six.   SEVEN WORDS FOR GOLDAs brass is symbolical of judgment (seen in the brazen altar), so gold is symbolical of glory, and glory is grace consummated. \"The LORD will give grace and glory\" (Psa 84:11). \"Whom He \njustified them He also glorified\" (Rom 8:30). Hence the number of spiritual perfection in the words used for gold: 1.  bhz (zah-hahv), from root to shine, glitter, like gold. Hence the common name for gold. This is earthly gold, than which the Word of God is more to be desired (Psa 19:7-10). 2.  zp (pahz), fine or refined gold. \"More to be desired are they than gold (bhz), yea, than much fine gold (zp),\" Psa 19:10. \"Therefore I love Thy commandments above gold (bhz); yea, above fine gold (zp),\" Psa 119:127. \"Thou settest a crown of pure gold (zp) upon his head\" (Psa 21:3). This word is therefore rightly used of the perfections of the living and the written Word. For He \"knew no sin\" (2 Cor 5:21). He \"did no sin\" (1 Peter 2:22). \"In Him was no \nsin\" (1 John 3:5). 3.  rcb (betzer), Job 22:24, 25, and rcb (b'tzar), gold ore or dust, from root to dig out or cut off. Hence used of gold broken up. The sense of Job 22:24, 25 is completely lost in the AV. In the RV it reads, verse 22. \"Receive, I pray thee, the law from His mouth, And lay up His words in thine heart. \nIf thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up; \nIf thou put away unrighteousness far from thy tents. \nAnd lay thou thy treasure (rcb) in the dust, \nAnd the gold of Ophir among the stones of the brooks; \nAnd the Almighty shall be thy treasure (rcb), \nAnd precious silver unto thee.\"Hence, if we have His Word abiding in us, He Himself is our treasure and our defence. \n\"His truth shall be thy shield\" (Psa 91:2). 4.  Cwrx (chah-rootz), from Crx (charatz), to chop or cut off short; then of the instrument which the stone-cutter uses; then of the pieces cut off. Hence gold in pieces or parts, as \npreserved in the word carats, specially applied to gold.* * Job 41:30; Psa 68:13; Prov 3:14, 8:10,19, 16:16; Isa 28:27, 41:15; Dan 9:25; Joel 3:14; Amos 1:3; Zech 9:3. As applied to God's \"workmanship\" we are cut off and triedas gold and precious stones. \"When He hath tried me I shall come forth as gold\" (Job 23:10). \"The furnace is for \ngold, but God trieth the hearts\" (Prov 17:3). 5.  Mtk (keh-them), from Mtk (kah-tham), to cut in, engrave (only in Jer 2:22, \"Mine iniquity is marked before me\"). As used of gold it implies that it is true and sterling, having the stamp or mark graved upon it.* As a title of the Psalms it is used with the \nprefix m, mem. Mtkm (michtam), writing, especially writing cut in or engraved with a stylus (like the LXX sthlografia, \"a sculptured writing\"**). btkm, michtahv, means simply a writing.*** A writing of David concerning David's Son and David's Lord. * It occurs Job 28:16,19, 31:24; Psa 45:9; Prov 25:12; Song 5:11; Isa 13:12; \nLam 4:1; Dan 10:5.** sthlh (steelee) was the word for grave-stone. Hence these Psalms point to Resurrection, Psa 16, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60. *** See Exo 32:16, 39:30; Deut 10:4; 2 Chron 21:12, 35:4, 36:22; Ezra 1:1; Isa 38:9. 6.  rwgs (s'gohr), from rgs (sah-gar), to shut up, enclose, used of gold as being solid, 1 Kings 6:20, \"he overlaid it with pure [marg., shut up] gold,\" i.e. gold plates, not merely gold leaf or wash. Occurs in Job 28:15, \"It cannot be gotten for gold,\" i.e. the wisdom of \nGod's Word. \"Every word of God is pure.\" \"Add thou not unto His words.\" 7.  bhd (d'hav, Chal.), meaning same as bhz (see No. 1); occurs only in Ezra and Daniel. Thus the fact of there being seven words for gold speaks to us of the spiritual perfection of the \nWord of God, which is so often compared to it.   SEVEN DIFFERENT NAMES FOR PALESTINEIn Old Testament only: 1.  \"The Holy Land,\" Zech 2:12 (#dqh tmd), Admath Ha-kadosh; LXX, h gh h agia; early Christian writers, Terra sancta). Very common in Middle Ages, now used only geographically. 2.  \"The Land of Jehovah,\" only in Hosea 9:3. Compare Lev 25:23; Psa 85:1; Isa 8:8; Joel 1:6, 3:2; Jer 16:18. In New Testament only: 3.  \"The Land of Promise,\" Heb 11:9. This title is based of course on the Old Testament and other Scriptures. Compare Gen 13:15; Deut 34:1-4; Gen 50:24; Eze 20:42; Acts 7:5. 4.  Judea, or the Land of Judah, hdwhy Cr). This name was at first used only of the territory of the Tribe of Judah (2 Chron 9:11), but after the Captivity it was used of the whole land, even including the East of the Jordan, Luke 1:5, 23:5; Matt 19:1; Acts 28:21. In Old and New Testament: 5.  \"The Land,\" Cr)h, Ha-ahretz, Ruth 1:1; Jer 12:11; Luke 5:25; Matt 27:45. This was a strictly Jewish name. 6.  \"The Land of Israel,\" l)r#y Cr). First used in 1 Sam 13:19, and occasionally in later books (2 Kings 5:2, 6:23). In Ezekiel oftener than in all the rest of the Bible. Matt 2:21. This name is also essentially Jewish. 7.  \"Canaan,\" N(nk (K'naan). So called after the son of Ham, by whose descendants it was at first inhabited (Gen 9:18, 10:15-19). It is therefore the oldest name, and was confined \nto the country west of the Jordan. See Exo 6:4, 15:15; Lev 14:34; Deut 22:39; Josh \n14:1; Psa 105:11; Gen 17:8. The name Palestine and Palestina, when the AV was made, was equivalent to Philistia. See \nPsalm 60:8, 87:4; 108:9. It is never used of the whole land, but only of \"Philistia.\" See Kitto, \nvol, iii. p. 386.

We give an example of Ezekiel 36I. Seven things concerning Israel today:\u0160 1.  Unclean in the sight of God (v 29). \n2.  Possessed of stony hearts (v 26). \n3.  Profaning God's holy Name (vv 20, 22). \n4.  Scattered among the heathen (v 19). \n5.  Covered with infamy and shame (vv 3-6). \n6.  Subject to heathen rule (v 6). \n7.  Desolate, forsaken, and a reproach (vv 3,4,30). II. Seven things God will do to Israel's oppressors:\u0160 1.  Speak in jealousy against them (v 5). 2.  Turn their glory into shame (v 7). 3.  Dispossess them of their occupation in the land (vv 10,11). \n4.  Give them to Israel for a possession (v 12). \n5.  Break their power to crush Israel (vv 13,14). \n6.  Vindicate and glorify His own name among them (v 22). \n7.  Teach them that He is God (vv 36,38). III. Seven things God will do for Israel:\u0160 1.  Gather them out of all countries (v 24). \n2.  Bring them into their own land (v 24). \n3.  Cleanse them from filth and idols (v 26). \n4.  Give them new hearts and minds, and His spirit (vv 26,27). \n5.  Make them again His people (v 28). \n6.  Cause them to flourish and multiply (v 30). \n7.  Make their end better than their beginning (v 11). IV. Seven things Israel themselves will do:\u0160 1.  Remember their past evil (v 31). \n2.  Loathe themselves for their iniquity (v 31). \n3.  Be ashamed and confounded (v 32). \n4.  Walk in Jehovah's statutes (v 27). \n5.  Keep His judgments (v 27). \n6.  Dwell for ever in the land (v 33). \n7.  Pray for the accomplishment of all these blessings (v 37).   GEMATRIAOne or two examples may be given of the numbers in names, etc., though many more are given \nelsewhere. l     Enoch, \"the seventh from Adam\" = 84 (7x12). l     \"Heirs of God,\" in the Greek = 1071 (7x153). l     \"The Lamb,\" in Greek = 651 (=7x93 or 7x3x31).   THE MULTIPLES OF SEVENas a rule partake of the same spiritual significance, and therefore we have not treated all of them \nspecially, but only where they have a peculiar significance arising from the power of the other \nfactor, as is the case with 42, 49, 70, etc. As an example of one of the other multiples we may take   THE ASSThe \"ass\" is the only animal that man is compared to: see Job 11:12, \"For vain man would be wise, though man be born a wild ass's colt.\" In Exodus 13:13 the first-born of man is classed with the firstling of an ass. Both must be redeemed with a lamb. This is repeated in Exodus 34:20. Nothing less than a sacrificial \nredemptive act could bring such a being to God. There are 28 (4x7) asses separately spoken of, and with these may be compared the 28 (4x7) \"times\" connected with \"vain man\" in Ecclesiastes 3:1-8. 1.  Balaam's ass (Num 22:21), \"a time to speak.\" \n2.  Achsah's ass (Josh 15:18), \"a time to get,\" when she lighted off her ass to make her request and get what she asked. 3.  Samson's (Judg 15:15), \"a time to war.\" \n4.  The Levite's (Judg 19:28), \"a time to be silent,\" when \"none answered,\" and he sent his desperate, silent message throughout Israel. 5.  Abigail's (1 Sam 25:20), \"a time of peace,\" when she met David and made peace for Nabal. 6.  Her second ass (v 42), \"a time to love,\" when she went to meet David and became his wife. 7.  Ahithophel's (2 Sam 17:23), \"a time to die,\" when he saddled his ass and went and hanged himself. 8.  The \"old prophet's\" ass (1 Kings 13:13,27), \"a time to kill,\" when he found \"the man of God\" killed by the lion. 9.  The \"man of God's\" ass (v 28), \"a time to mourn,\" when the old prophet laid him thereon \"to mourn and to bury him.\" 10.  The Shunamite's ass (2 Kings 4:24), \"a time to heal,\" when she rode to Elisha, who restored her son. 11.  Mephibosheth's (2 Sam 19:26), \"a time to embrace,\" when he would go and salute David. 12.  Shimei's (1 Kings 2:40), \"a time to die.\" \n13.  Jesse's (1 Sam 16:20), \"a time to live\" (21). \n14.  Moses' (Exo 4:20-26), \"a time to kill,\" when he incurred the judgment of Genesis 17:14. \n15.  Abraham's (Gen 22:3), \"a time to get and a time to lose,\" when God demanded back the son He had given. 16.  The Saviour's ass (Matt 20:5), \"a time to laugh,\" when the daughter of Jerusalem rejoiced. 17.  The young, its foal (Matt 21:5). \n18.  -28. The asses of Jacob's sons (Gen 44:13), filling up the other \"times.\"   ADDITIONAL MISCELLANEOUS ILLUSTRATIONSSeven miracles wrought by Christ on the Sabbath day:\u0160 1.  The withered hand, Matt 12:9. 2.  The unclean spirit, Mark 1:21. \n3.  Peter's wife's mother, Mark 1:29. \n4.  The woman, Luke 13:11. \n5.  The man with dropsy, Luke 14:2. \n6.  The impotent man, John 5:8,9. \n7.  The man born blind, John 9:14. \"The last day\" mentioned seven times in John's Gospel:\u0160John 6:39, 40, 44, 54, 7:37, 11:24, \n12:48.   Back | Contents | Next  Back | Contents | Next PART II ITS SPIRITUAL SIGNIFICANCE EIGHTIn Hebrew the number eight is hnm# (Sh'moneh), from the root Nm# (Shah'meyn), \"to make fat,\" \"cover with fat,\" \"to super-abound.\" As a participle it means \"one who abounds in strength,\" \netc. As a noun it is \"superabundant fertility,\" \"oil,\" etc. So that as a numeral it is the \nsuperabundant number. As seven was so called because the seventh day was the day of \ncompletion and rest, so eight, as the eighth day, was over and above this perfect completion, \nand was indeed the first of a new series, as well as being the eighth. Thus it already represents \ntwo numbers in one, the first and eighth. Let us first consider the connection between   EIGHT AND SEVEN TOGETHERJust as we saw the connection between the numbers six and seven together (pp. 158-167), so we must note the remarkable connection between seven and eight when used together. \nSeven means, as we have seen, according to its etymology, that which is spiritually complete or satisfying; while eight denotes that which is superabundant or satiating. Hence we often find \nthese two numbers associated with these distinctions.   JEHOVAH'S COVENANTS WITH ABRAHAMwere eight in number; seven before Isaac was offered up, and the eighth when he had been received \"in a figure\" from the dead. 1.  Gen 12:1-3, sovereignty. \n2.  Gen 12:7, the seed. \n3.  Gen 13:14-17, Divine assurance, rising and walking on resurrection ground. \n4.  Gen 15:13-21, the limits of the land; the 400 years; the 4th generation. \n5.  Gen 17:1-22, invincible grace. \n6.  Gen 18:9-15, human failure and imperfection. \n7.  Gen 21:12, Spiritual blessing headed up in the seed. \n8.  Gen 22:15-18, resurrection blessing. The first three are marked off from the others by the words \"after these things,\" 15:1. The next four are marked off from the eighth by similar separating words, repeated in 22:1. It will be noted that each covenant blessing is stamped with the character of its numerical significance.   JOSEPH'S TYPICAL COMMUNICATIONS WITH HIS BRETHRENwere eight in number. Seven times before Jacob's death, and an eighth time after. 1.  In Genesis 37:6, he tells his dream about the sheaves of wheat (earthly glory). 2.  His second dream about the sun, moon, and stars (heavenly glory, completing the double witness of John 3:12). 3.  His message of love to them from his father, when he is rejected and cast into the pit, but raised (unknown to them) to the right hand of power. 4.  They are compelled to go to Joseph, Genesis 42. \n5.  Again they go, Genesis 43:15. \n6.  A third time (Gen 44:13), when Joseph proclaims himself. Three times they had denied him. Three times they have to go to him; and the third time, after deep exercise of heart, \nreach the place of blessing. But it is (like the No. 6) incomplete. It needs the 7.  \"And Israel [no longer Jacob] took his journey with all that he had\" (Gen 46). Nothing more is to be desired, so he says, \"Now let me die, since I have seen thy face,\" etc. (v \n30). The history is spiritually complete; but there remains another communication. 8.  Jacob has passed away, and they are face to face with Joseph, a type of Christ in resurrection glory (Gen 50:15, etc.).   EXODUS 21:23-25There are eight particulars in connection with punishment; but seven stand in a different \ncategory, not being possible if the eighth were inflicted, viz., \"Life for life.\" 1. Life for life, 82. Eye for eye, 73. Tooth for tooth,4. Hand for hand,\n5. Foot for foot,\n6. Burning for burning,\n7. Wound for wound,\n8. Stripe for stripe.  EXODUS 40Seven times we have the phrase \"As the LORD commanded Moses,\"* and once (v 16), \"according to all that the LORD commanded him.\" * Verse 23, \"had commanded,\" is the same as the other six in the Hebrew.   THE FEAST OF TABERNACLESwas the only feast which was kept eight days. The eighth is distinguished from the seventh. See \nLeviticus 23:39, and compare verses 34-36; Numbers 29:39, and Nehemiah 8:18.   2 CHRONICLES 6Eight appeals of Solomon for his prayer to be heard. Seven times, \"Hear Thou from heaven,\" and once (v 21), \"Hear Thou from thy dwelling-place, from heaven.\" Similarly in 1 Kings 8, the \nparallel passage.   ISAIAH 5:1, 2There are eight sentences describing the vineyard, but seven give the characteristics, and one the result.   THE STEPS IN EZEKIEL'S TEMPLESeven led into the outer court (40:22,26), and eight led from the outer to the inner (40:31,34,37).* * How many led into the Temple the Hebrew Text does not say. The Septuagint says there were ten. See verse 49, RV text and margin. The seven led from labour to rest, the eight from rest to worship.   THE LORD JESUS WAS ON A MOUNTAINeight times.* Seven times were before the cross, but the eighth time after He rose from the dead. * Omitting of course the scene in the Temptation. EPHESIANS 4:4-6Seven unities, but the seventh is two-fold\u0160\"God and Father\"\u0160making eight in all.   COLOSSIANS 3:12, 13There are seven graces, but (v 14) over all these there is \"love,\" which is the bond of perfectness, the upper garment which completes and unites the others.   JAMES 3:17\"The wisdom that is from above\" is enumerated in seven particulars, but the fifth is double, making eight in all (\"full of mercy and good fruits\").   ABRAHAM'S SONSwere eight in number; but seven were \"born after the flesh,\" while one, the eighth, was \"by promise.\"   THE CONSECRATION OF AARON AND HIS SONSwas on the eighth day, after abiding \"at the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation day and night seven days\" (Lev 8:35, 9:1).   IN SOLOMON'S TEMPLEthere were eight classes of furniture, while in the Tabernacle there were seven:\u0160 Temple Tabernacle1 Ark 1 Ark1 Mercy-seat 1 Mercy-seat1 Altar of Incense 1 Altar of Incense10 Candlesticks 1 Candlestick10 Tables of shewbread 1 Table of shewbread1 Altar of burnt-offering 1 Altar of burnt-offering10 Lavers 1 Laver1 Brasen Sea  35 (5x7) 7  THE SABBATH TO BE KEPT HOLYThere were eight commands in all. Seven by Jehovah (Exo 20:8; Deut 5:12, repetition; 23:12, \n31:13, 34:21; Lev 19:3,30, 23:3: one by Moses, Exo 35:2).   DAVID WAS THE EIGHTH SON OF JESSEaccording to 1 Samuel 16:6, etc., and 1 Samuel 17:12; but owing doubtless to the death of one son without issue, and hence excluded from the genealogies, David would be called in 1 \nChronicles 2:15 \"the seventh.\" These will suffice to show the connection between the numbers seven and eight. Let us now consider the number   EIGHT BY ITSELFIt is 7 plus 1. Hence it is the number specially associated with Resurrection and Regeneration, and the beginning of a new era or order. When the whole earth was covered with the flood, it was Noah \"the eighth person\" (2 Peter 2:5) who stepped out on to a new earth to commence a new order of things. \"Eight souls\" (1 Peter \n3:20) passed through it with him to the new or regenerated world. Hence, too, circumcision was to be performed on the eighth day (Gen 17:12), because it was the foreshadowing of the true circumcision of the heart, that which was to be \"made without hands,\" even \"the putting off of the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ\" (Col 2:11). \nThis is connected with the new creation. The first-born was to be given to Jehovah on the eighth day (Exo 22:29,30). But   RESURRECTIONis the great truth which is signified. Christ rose from the dead on \"the first day of the week,\" that was of necessity the eighth day. And it is remarkable that the Bible contains the record of Eight individual Resurrections(other than the Lord and the saints): 3 in the Old Testament \n3 in the Gospels \n2 in Acts 9 and 20The three in the Old Testament correspond to the three raised by our Lord. 1.  The son of a widow\u0160 Zarepta (1 Kings 17:17-25) and \nNain (Luke 7:11-18). 2.  The child of a rich person\u0160 Son of the woman of Shunem (2 Kings 4:32-37), \nThe daughter of Jarius (Mark 5:35; Luke 8:49). 3.  A full grown man...after burial\u0160 In Elisha's tomb (2 Kings 13:20,21), \nLazarus (John 11).   THE FEAST OF TABERNACLESlasted eight days, with a special reference to the Incarnation (John 1:14).   THE TRANSFIGURATIONalso took place on the eighth day (inclusive reckoning) after the first announcement of Christ's \"sufferings,\" and it was the showing forth of the \"glory\" which should follow at His coming \nagain.   THE FIRST CUBEEight is the first cubic number, the cube of two, 2 x 2 x 2. We have seen that three is the symbol of the first plane figure, and that four is the first square. So here, in the first cube, we see \nsomething of transcendent perfection indicated, something, the length and breadth and height of \nwhich are equal. This significance of the cube is seen in the fact that the \"Holy of Holies,\" both \nin the Tabernacle and in the Temple, were cubes. In the Tabernacle it was a cube of 10 cubits. \nIn the Temple it was a cube of 20 cubits. In Revelation 20 the New Jerusalem is to be a cube of \n12,000 furlongs. Dr. Milo Mahan is inclined to believe that the Ark of Noah, too, had a kind of \nsacred Shechinah in \"the window finished in a cubit above\"\u0160a cube of one. If so, we have the \nseries of cubes:\u0160 1 = The Ark103 = 1,000, The Tabernacle203 = 8,000, The Temple12,0003 = 1,728,*000,000,000, the New Jerusalem* This 1728, too, is a remarkable number, viz., 82 x 33.   EIGHT SONGS IN THE OLD TESTAMENToutside the Psalms: 1.  Redemption, Exodus 15. \n2.  Supply and maintenance, Numbers 21:17. \n3.  Moses witnessing to the grace of God and the unfaithfulness of man, Deuteronomy 32. \n4.  Victory over oppression, Judges 5. \n5.  David, God's elect, delivered from all his foes, 2 Samuel 22. \n6.  The Song of Songs. \n7.  The song of the well-beloved touching Israel, God's vineyard, Isaiah 5. \n8.  This (the eighth) waits to be sung on resurrection ground (Isa 26), for it does not come till after \"death is swallowed up in victory,\" 25:8.   THE MIRACLES OF ELIJAHwere eight in number, marking the Divine character of his mission: 1.  The shutting up of heaven, 1 Kings 17:1; James 5:17; Luke 4:25. 2.  Multiplying the widow's meal, 2 Kings 17:14-16. \n3.  Raising the widow's son, verses 17-23. \n4.  Causing fire to come down from heaven, 1 Kings 18:37, 38. \n5.  Causing rain to come down from heaven, verses 41-45. \n6.  Causing fire to come down from heaven, 2 Kings 1:10. \n7.  The same, verse 12. \n8.  Dividing the Jordan, 2 Kings 2:8.   THE MIRACLES OF ELISHAwere double in number, viz. sixteen, for his request was, \"Let a double portion of thy spirit be \nupon me,\" 2 Kings 2:9: 1.  Dividing the Jordan, 2 Kings 2:14. \n2.  Healing the waters, verse 21. \n3.  Cursing the young men,* verse 24. \n4.  Procuring water for the three kings, 2 Kings 3:16-20. \n5.  Multiplying the widow's oil, 2 Kings 4:1-7. \n6.  Raising the widow's son, 4:37. \n7.  Healing the deadly pottage, verse 38. \n8.  Feeding the hundred men, verses 42-44. \n9.  The healing of Naaman, 2 Kings 5:1-19. 10.  The smiting of Gehazi, verses 20-27. \n11.  Causing the iron to swim, 2 Kings 6:1-7. \n12.  Opening the eyes of his servant, verse 17. \n13.  Smiting the Syrian army with blindness, verse 18. \n14.  Restoring their sight, verse 20. \n15.  Arresting the king's messenger, verses 30-33. \n16.  A dead man raised by touching his bones, 2 Kings 13:20, 21. * The word is used of Isaac, aged 28; Joseph when 39; Rehoboam when 40; Shadrach and his companions in Babylon. The use and significance of the number eight in Scripture is seen to recur in marvelous exactitude. It may indeed be said that   EIGHT IS THE DOMINICAL NUMBER,for everywhere it has to do with the LORD. It is the number of His name, IHSOUS, Jesus:\u0160 I = 10H = 8S \n= 200O \n= 70U \n= 400S \n= 200  888It is the number stamped upon the Old Testament, the numbers of its books in all the MSS being \n24 (3x8). See p. 25. In the book which relates to His great Apocalypse or Revelation, there are in the introduction \nwhich sets forth the glory of the Lord, to be revealed in the day of the Lord, eight references to \nthe Old Testament on which the claims of His Lordship are based.   THE EIGHT REFERENCES TO THE OLD TESTAMENT IN REVELATION 1It will be noted, moreover, that these are not given at haphazard. Our attention is called to their importance by the order in which they are given. They are arranged in the form of an epanodos, \nthe first being from the same book as the eighth, the second corresponding in the same way to \nthe seventh, the third to the sixth, and the fourth to the fifth. Thus the Divine seal of \nsuperabundant perfection is there set on the Scriptures which declare the Lordship of Jesus: A. 5. Isaiah 55:4.B. 7-. Daniel 7:13. C. -7. Zechariah 12:10.D. 8. Isaiah 41:4, 44:6, \n48:12. D. 11. Isaiah 41:4, 44:6; 48:12. C. 12. Zechariah 4:2. B. 13-15. Daniel 7:9, 13, 22, 10:5, 6. A. -16-. Isaiah 49:2.   OTHER DOMINICAL NAMES OF JESUSare also marked by gematria and stamped with the number eight as a factor: l     CristoV, Christ, 1480 (8x185). l     KurioV, Lord, 800 (8x100). l     KurioV hmwn, Our Lord, 1768 (8x221). l     Swthr, Saviour, 1408 (82x 32). l     'Emmanouhl, Emmanuel, 25600, (83x50). l     Messias, Messiah, 656 (8x82). l     UioV, Son, 880 (8x110). We ought also to note that the other factors, beside the prevailing eight, are full of significance. All this speaks to us, if we have \"ears to hear,\" that \"God hath glorified His Son Jesus\" (Acts 3:13), and \"hath made that same Jesus...both Lord and Christ\" (Acts 2:36). But here we must consider the two numbers \n  EIGHT AND THIRTEEN TOGETHERthat we may afterwards compare and contrast the two. For this purpose we must consider the number thirteen here, and out of its otherwise proper order. As to the significance of thirteen, all are aware that it has come down to us as a number of ill-omen. Many superstitions cluster around it, and various explanations are current concerning \nthem. Unfortunately, those who go backwards to find a reason seldom go back far enough. The popular explanations do not, so far as we are aware, go further back than the Apostles. But we \nmust go back to the first occurrence of the number thirteen in order to discover the key to its \nsignificance. It occurs first in Gen 14:4, where we read \"Twelve years they served \nChedorlaomer, and the thirteenth year they REBELLED.\" Hence every occurrence of the number thirteen, and likewise of every multiple of it, stamps that with which it stands in connection with rebellion, apostasy, defection, corruption, \ndisintegration, revolution, or some kindred idea. The second mention of thirteen is in connection with Ishmael, Gen 17:25. He was thirteen years old when Abraham circumcised him and admitted him into the covenant to which he was a \nstranger in heart, and which ended in his rebellion and rejection. We see it stamped upon the very fore-front of Revelation. For while the opening statement of Gen 1:1 is composed of seven words and twenty-eight letters (4x7), the second verse consists of \nfourteen words, but fifty-two letters; fifty-two being 4x13 tells of some apostasy or rebellion \nwhich caused the ruin of which that verse speaks. But it is when we come to   GEMATRIAthat the most wonderful results are seen. These results may be stated thus, briefly: That the names of the LORD's people are multiples of eight, while the names of those who apostatized, or \nrebelled, or who were in any sense His enemies, are multiples of thirteen. This statement, if it be \nproved, is one of the greatest evidences of verbal inspiration which the world has yet seen. The \ndiscovery of the great principle is due, we believe, to the late Dr. Milo Mahan, of New York, \nwho has given many examples of it in his work already referred to, now long out of print. The \neffect of this law can hardly be estimated in establishing the presence of an ever-present \nworking of the Holy Spirit in inditing the very words and even the letters of Scripture. No human \nforesight or arrangement could have secured such a result beforehand; no human powers could \nhave carried it out in such perfection. No matter where we look, we find the working of the law \nwithout cessation, without a break, without a flaw from beginning to end. Only one conclusion is \npossible, and that is that the Bible has but one Author, an eternal, omniscient Author, designing, \nsuperintending, working, and carrying out His own infinite plans. Let us take a survey of this wondrous field \n  THE SETH AND CAIN LINESThe numerical value of the Seth line of names collectively is a multiple of 8; whilst those of the Cain line collectively is a multiple of 13. The Seth Line of Names Adam 45Seth 700Enos 357 Cainan 210 Mahalaleel 136 Jared 214 Enoch 84 Methuselah 784 Lamech 90 Noah 58 Japheth* 490 (8x396) 3168 * Japheth was the eldest son of Noah, though Shem was chosen for the genealogy of Jesus Christ. Taking the Noah group separately, we have: Noah 58 Shem 340 Ham 48 Japheth 490 (8x9x13) 936Without Ham, the three names, Noah, Shem, and Japheth, equal 888. With Ham they equal 936, as above; but this, though it is a multiple of 8, is at the same time a multiple of 13, and of 9 also, \nthe number of judgment. The gematria of the whole Scripture, Gen 5:6-24, which contains the record of these names, amounts to 62960 (or 8x7870). The Cain Line of Names Adam 45 Cain 160 Enoch 84 Irad 284 Mehujael 95 Methusael 777 Lamech 90 Jabal 42 Jubal 48 Tubal Cain 598 (13x9x19) 2223 The family of Lamech is also significant if looked at separately: l     Lamech and Adah 169 (132) l     The two wives, Adah and Zillah 611 (13x47) l     Jabal, his firstborn, the father of the Bedouin 42 (the No. of Antichrist) l     Tubal Cain 598 (13x46) l     The whole family, including the daughter, Naamah 1924 (or 13x148) The history of the Cain family is given in Gen 4:1-25, and spreads over 130 years (13x10). See Gen 5:3. Further, the whole Scripture which records the history, Gen 4:1-25, yields by gematria 76882 (13x5914). There is, however, a remarkable exception which \"proves the rule.\" Verse 25 records \nthe birth of Seth, and its value is 6560 (8x820); verse 26, also, which records the birth of his son \nEnos, and tells how men began then to \"call upon the name of the LORD,\" yields 3064 (8x383). Contrast this with verse 1, where the numerical value of the words \"and she conceived and bare Cain\" is 1612 (13x124). The years of Adam during the days of Cain, before the birth of Seth, were 130 (13x10): see Gen 5:3. While after the birth of Seth he lived 800 years (8x100), Gen 5:4.   THE GEMATRIA OF LAMECH'S SONGin Gen 4:23,24, is 4667 (13x359); while the sentence pronounced on Cain in vv 10-13 is 10283 (13x791).   GENESIS VIThe record in Gen 6, which gives the apostasy of man, leading up to the judgment of the Flood, is stamped and branded throughout with significant numbers: l     Verses 1-3 amount to 7272 (6x1212). l     Verse 2 amounts to 3198 (13x6x41). l     Verse 4, \"the same were mighty men which were of old, men of renown\" 1703 (13x131). l     Verses 5-7, which speak concerning the corruption 10335 (13x795). l     Verses 1-7 21672 (62x602). But now contrast vv 8-10 concerning Noah--\"But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD,\" etc., 7008 (8x876): l     Verses 11-17, the end of all flesh, the command to build the ark, and the threat of the \nFlood 33540 (13x2580). l     Verses 14-16, concerning the ark 17668 (4x4417). l     Verses 12, 13 and 17 together, concerning the violence and corruption 13320 (666x20). l     Verses 18-22, which speak of the covenant to save Noah and his house, while they are \nstamped with the number 13 (which is the number of atonement as well as of sin, see \nbelow), are stamped also with the triple five, the 15 of perfect grace by which Noah was \ncalled, and by the number 2, which tells of incarnation and deliverance. The gematria \nof these verses is 15002 (13x1154).   GENESIS 10:15-18 The Canaanite names: Canaan 190 And 6 Sidon 154 Heth 408 The Jebusite 93 The Amorite 256 The Girgashite 521 The Hivite 29 The Arkite 385 The Sinite 135 The Arvadite 226 The Zemarite 345 The Hamathite 463 (132x19) 3211 THE DESCENDANTS OF JOKTAN (Gen 10:25-29) Joktan (the 13th from Shem)(132) 169 Peleg (his brother) 113 Salah (his grandfather) (132x2) 338 His 13 sons: Almodad 85 Sheleph 410 Hazarmaveth 744 Jerah 218 Hadoram 255 Uzal 44 Diklah 139 Obal 108 Abimael 84 Sheba 303 Ophir 287 Havilah 59 Jobab 20 (13x212) 2756 The whole passage (Gen 10:25-29) yields the number 10647 (132x63). Such are the pains taken to emphasise the rise of the progenitors of the Saracens, for Joktan settled in S. Arabia, while Ishmael settled in Arabia Petrea.   THE LINE OF ARPHAXAD (Gen 11:10-27) Shem 340 Arphaxad 605 Salah 338 Eber 272 Peleg 113 Reu 276 Serug 509 Nahor 264 Terah 608 Abram 243 (8x446) 3568   NAHOR'S FAMILY Nahor 264 Haran 255 Lot 45 Sarai 510 Milcah 95 Iscah 95 (8x158) 1264 Thus the entire generation is 4832 (8x604).   THE GENERATIONS OF ABRAHAMAbraham had eight sons. Seven of them were born \"after the flesh,\" while the eighth was \"by promise.\" (8x31) Abraham 248 (8x2x13) Isaac* 208 (8x57) 456 * Isaac's household was a divided one, as well as Jacob's; hence we have the 13 as a factor as well as 8.   JACOB'S FAMILY(7x2x13) Jacob 182 Leah 36 Rachel 238 (8x57) 456 Leah's Six Sons Reuben 259 Simeon 466 Levi 46 Judah 30 Issachar 830 Zebulon 95 (13x2+1700) 1726 Add parents' names (Jacob 182, and Leah 36), and we have 1944 (8x243). Rachel's Two Sons (Spelling taken as in Gen 35:22-26) Joseph 156 Benjamin 152 (77x4) 308 Rachel's Maid Bilhah 42 Dan 54 Naphtali 570 666 Leah's Maid Zilpah 122 Gad 7 Asher 501 Add Leah 36 666 The whole family of Jacob, including Ephraim (331) and Manasseh (395) = 4512 (83x4000).   THE TWELVE TRIBESare enumerated in some 18 (3x6) different ways, in which one is always omitted. For there were 12 tribes; but there were also 13, telling of God's design for perfect government, and of man's \napostasy from that government. l     In Deut 32 Simeon is left out. l     In Rev 7 Dan and Ephraim are omitted (Joseph and Levi being inserted). l     Generally it is Levi that is omitted. l     Arranged in their 4 camps, as in Num 2, their value is 3736 (8x467). l     Arranged as in Rev 7, the value (according to the Greek spelling, of course) is 8480 \n(8x1060). l     Arranged as in Num 13:3-16, in connection with the rebellion on the return of the 12 \nspies, we see defection at once; for all the representatives of the tribes failed except \nCaleb and Joshua (788). m     The whole passage = 17654 (13x1358). m     From verse 4-16 = 12038 (13x926). To go back, however, to Genesis, we now take   ISHMAEL'S TWELVE SONS (Gen 25:12-17) Now these 40 The generations of 836 Ishmael 451 Nebaioth 462 Kedar 304 Abdeel 38 Mibsam 382 Mishmah 450 Dumah 55 Massa 341 Hadar 212 Tema 451 Jetur 225 Naphish 440 Kedemah 149 (13x12x31) 4836   THE ELEVEN DUKES OF EDOMGen 36:40-43 is by gematria 9880: thus-- l     Verse 40 = 5453 l     Verse 41 = 670 l     Verse 42 = 1340 l     Verse 43 = 2417 (as far as \"he is Esau\") l     Total 9880 (13x760) The word Pwl) (al-luph), \"duke,\" amounts to 117 (13x9). And eleven times repeated, it is still a multiple of 13, viz., 1287 (13x99).   THE ABRAHAM-KETURAH GROUP (Gen 25:1,2) (8x31) Abraham 248 (8x40) Keturah 320 Zimran 297 Jokshan 460 Medan 94 Midian 104 Ishbak 412 Shuah 314 (13x173) 2249   THEIR DESCENDANTS IN GEN 25:3 Shebah 303 Dedan 58 Sons of Dedan 120 (13x37) 481 Asshurim 547 Letushim 385 Leummim 121 (13x81) 1053   THE SONS OF MIDIAN (Gen 25:4) Sons of Midian 166 Ephah 165 Epher 350 Hanoch 58 Abidah 87 Eldaah 110 (13x72) 936 The phrase which concludes the lists, \"All these are the sons of Keturah,\" has for its value 468 (13x36), making with the numbers above 5213 for the whole group, or 13x401. The whole passage is also a multiple of 13.   THE INCESTUOUS CHILDREN OF LOT (Gen 19) Ammon 166 Ammi 120 (13x22) 286 Ben-Ammi (children of Ammi) 182 (13x14)The whole passage (Gen 19:31-38) is a multiple of 13   GENESIS 19l     \"And there came two angels to Sodom at even,\" 640 (8x80) l     \"And Lot sat in the gate of Sodom\"* = 1313 l     Verse 1. The whole verse, 4299, significant of Antichrist (42) and judgment (9). l     Verses 1-25 = 90441 (13x9x773). l     Verses 26-29, describing the results of the overthrow = 14274 (13x9x122). l     Verses 1-29, the entire account = 104715 (13x9x895). l     Lots words in verse 7 = 777. Verse 25. The work of the LORD in the overthrow = 2888. l     The account in the Second Epistle of Peter = 6999 * Even the expression in 2 Peter 2:7, \"and righteous Lot,\" is 1326 (13x102). It will be observed how we have here not only the number thirteen, but also the number nine, \nwhich...is the number of judgment.   THE DESTRUCTION OF JERICHOis also stamped with the number thirteen, though not by gematria, for the city was compassed once each day for six days, and seven times on the seventh day, making 13 times in all (6+7). \nJericho, wxry, is 234 which is 13x2x9 (nine being the number of judgment).   THE TWELVE JUDGESwho were raised up as saviours in a time of apostasy and rebellion exhibit both these factors, 8 and 13 Othniel 561 Ehud 16 Shamgar 543 Barak 302 Gideon 133 Tola 506 Jair 221 Jephthah 498 Ibzan 143 Elon 97 Abdon 132 Samson 696 (8x13x37) 3848 Abimelech the usurper (Judges 9) by his name (13x4) Ben 52 (13x24) Jerubbaal 312 (13x28) 364 The Judges period ends under Samuel, 377 (13x29), and the last three names which come before us are-- Eli, Hophni, and Phinehas, which together amount to 462 (42x11).   THE SAUL GROUP OF NAMES (1 Sam 14:49-51) Saul 337 Kish 760 Sons of Saul 399 Jonathan 516 Ishui 326 Melchishua 476 Ahinoam 179 Merab 242 Michal 100 Abner son of Ner 565 (13x300) 3900   THE JUDAH AND ISRAEL LINES OF KINGSare stamped in a remarkable manner with these numbers. There are two periods specially marked with regard to Israel. The number 65 is associated with the separate existence of the Ten Tribes in Isa 7:8, \"Within threescore and five years shall Ephraim be broken, that it be not a people.\" From that time, that \nis to say, from the last year of Jeroboam II to the carrying away of Israel was exactly 65 years, \nor 5 times 13, which characterised the disintegration which was going on in the nation. But, more than this, the number 390 was also stamped upon Israel as being the whole duration of the separate existence of the Ten Tribes from the day they rebelled against Rehoboam to the \nday they were led away captive. This we see from Eze 4:4, 5, where the command was given to \nEzekiel, \"Lie thou upon thy left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it; \naccording to the number of the days that thou shalt be upon it, thou shalt bear their iniquity. For \nI have laid upon thee the years of their iniquity according to the number of the days, three \nhundred and ninety days; so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.\" Now 390 is thirteen times thirty,* and the duration of Israel's rebellion is sufficiently and appropriately branded upon it. * Commentators entirely miss the point when they say that 390 = 10x39, instead of 13x30! On the other hand, when we turn to Judah we see the number 8 pervading it. For the same prophet, in the next verse, is commanded to lie on his right side forty days to bear the iniquity of \nthe house of Judah--each day for a year. We ought to note in passing that the name of Ezekiel, \nwho foretells the duration and end of this apostasy, is 156 (13x12); while the words of the prophecy, Eze 4:1-6, amount to 36673 (132x7x31), and the whole passage, 4:1-8, to 43069 (13x3313). The fulfillment ought also to be noted. The 390 years were to signify not only the years of apostasy, but were also to signify the 390 days of the siege of Jerusalem; viz., 13 months \n(30x13). The siege commenced on the 10th day of the 10th month of the 9th year of Zedekiah (2 \nKings 25:1-4), and it was taken on the 9th day of the 4th month of the 11th year of the same \nking. This gives a period of 18 months. But the siege was raised for about 5 months (see Jer 37), \nwhile Nebuchadnezzar's army was withdrawn for fear of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who had come \nup to meet him. Thus we have the two numbers stamped by the history; upon Judah 8, and upon Israel 13. Now look at \n  THE LIST OF JUDAH'S KINGS[1] Rehoboam 320 Abijam 53 [2]Asa 62 Jehoshaphat 410 Jehoram 261 Ahaziah 37 Athaliah 515 Jehoash 322 [3]Amaziah 152 [4]Azariah (Uzziah) 292 Jotham 456 Ahaz 16 Hezekiah 136 Manasseh 395 Amon 97 Josiah 332 Jehoahaz 37 Jehoiakim 181 Jehoiachin 111 Zedekiah 215 (8x550) 4400 1. The spelling, which sometimes varies, is taken according to the first occurrence of the name.2. In the 39th (3x13) year of his reign he forsook the LORD (2 Chron 16:12). \n3. Amaziah = 146 or 152 according to the spelling. If 146, then the total will be 4394 (132x2). But if we add Saul 337, David 14, and Solomon 375, it is 5120 (83x10). 4. He had reigned 52 (4x13) years when he apostatized (2 Chron 26:3,21).  THE ISRAELITE KINGSJeroboam I 322 Nadab 56 Baasha 373 Elah 36 Zimri 257 Omri 320 Ahab 12 Ahaziah 37 Jehoram 261 Jehu 22 Jehoahaz 37 Joash 317 Jeroboam II 322 Zachariah 242 Shallum 376 Menahem 138 Pekahiah 203 Pekah 188 Hoshea 381 (13x300) 3900   THE LEADERS WHO RETURNED FROM BABYLON (Ezra 2:2) Zurubbabel 241 Jeshua 386 Nehemiah 113 Seraiah 515 Reelaiah 315 Mordecai 274 Bilshan 382 *Mizpar 380 Bigvai 21 Rehum 254 Baanah 127 (82x47) 3008 * In the Hebrew Text rpsm, Mizpar is repeated again after Baanah. If we count this in, then the total, instead of 3008, will be 3388, which though not a multiple of 8 is very significant. Other chiefs mentioned in other connections are-- Shesbazzar, the prince of Judah 892 Ezra the scribe 619 Nehemiah 113 (8x203) 1624 It is difficult to observe a strict order in the presentation of these phenomena, because the results are best shown by direct contrast. For example, if we take out the names of the \nadversaries who came in direct opposition to the Lord, the law will be more clearly seen.   THE ADVERSARIES OF EZRA (4:7-9) Bishlam 372 Mithredath 1044 Tabeel 42 \"And the rest of their companions\" 989 Rehum the chancellor 475 Shimshai the scribe 991 (13x301) 3913 These Companions (Ezra 4:9) are the-- Dinaites 75 Apharsathchites 772 Tarpelites 330 Apharsites 352 Archevites 237 Babylonians 45 Susanchites 687 Dehavites 16 Elamites 151 (13x205) 2665 Together they all make 6578 (13x506). The men who took strange wives (Ezra 10:17-44) were in number 113. The gematria of their names is 38194 (132x226).   THE ADVERSARIES OF NEHEMIAHas mentioned and named in 2:19, 4:7, and 13:4: Sanballat the Horonite 424 And Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite 294 And Geshem the Arabian 636 And the Arabians 333 And the Ammonites 221 And the Ashdodites 376 Eliashib the priest 433 (13x209) 2717 With this we may note the 6-fold nature of their opposition as shown on p. 153.   DANIEL AND HIS COMPANIONS Daniel 95 Hananiah 120 Misael 381 Azariah 292 888 But their Chaldean names, given by Nebuchadnezzar, make a number of no significance whatever.   THE ENEMIES OF GOD AND HIS PEOPLEas named in Scripture are generally multiples of thirteen. Let us begin with the great enemy himself, always remembering that though we may give the English for the sake of clearness, the gematria always refers to the original Hebrew or Greek: l     Satan, in Hebrew = 364 (13x28) l     Satan, in Greek = 2197 (133) l     \"That old serpent, even Satan\" (o ofiV o arcaioV...kai o SatanaV) = 2756 (13x212) l     \"Ha-Seraph\" (Num 21:8) = 585 (13x45) l     Beelzebub (with art.) = 598 (13x46) l     Belial - 78 (13x6) l     Drakwn (Drakon), Dragon (Rev 12:9) = 975 (13x75) l     'OfiV (Ophis), Serpent = 780 (13x60) l     Murderer = 1820 (13x140) l     Tempter = 1053 (13x81) l     The Scape-goat = 585 (13x45) l     The Lion (Psa 91:13) = 338 (13x26) l     \"As a Lion\" (1 Peter 5:8) = 1885 (13x145) l     \"The Power of the Enemy\" (Luke 10:9) = 2509 (13x193) l     \"Your adversary, the Devil, as a roaring lion\" = 6032 (13x464) l     Fowler (Psa 91:3) = 416 (13x32) l     \"Who is called the Devil and Satan\" (o kaloumenoV diaboloV kai o SatanaV) = 2197 (133) l     \"Seven Devils\" = 572 (13x44) l     \"Because the Prince of this world is judged\" (John 16:11) = 5577 (132x33) l     \"When he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own, for he is a liar\" (John 8:44) = 7072 (13x544) Genesis 3where the Devil is first mentioned and revealed. The opening words: l     \"The Serpent was more subtle than all the beasts of the field\" = 1521 (132x9) l     The history of the Temptation, vv 1-7 = 24011 (13x1847) l     The second section (vv 8-11) = 49478 (132x1903) l     The third section (vv 22-24), which records the expulsion from Eden = 10894 (13x838) l     The whole chapter = 84383 (13x6491) l     Eve's confession (v 13) = 3692 (13x284) l     Verse 8, which describes the act of the LORD God, is, on the contrary, 4064 (8x508) l     Verse 21, which records the Divinely prepared clothing in grace = 2856 (7x8x51) l     Verse 15, which we might expect to find significant, being the great primeval prophetic promise, is 4266 (33x158); where we have the 42, the 66, of Antichrist, and the 9 of judgment. l     Verse 16, containing the hope of the promised seed, added to v 15 = 8512 (8000+83) Isaiah 27:1l     \"The piercing Serpent, even Leviathan\" = 1170 (13x90) l     \"That crooked Serpent\" = 1014 (132x6) l     \"The Dragon that is in the sea\" = 1469 (13x113) Isaiah 14:29l     Rejoice not thou, whole Palestina, because the rod of him that smote thee is broken: for out of the serpent's root shall come forth a cockatrice (marg. adder), and his fruit shall \nbe a fiery flying serpent\" = 5369 (13x413) Psalm 75:15l     \"Thou smotest the heads of Leviathan in pieces, and gavest him for meat for the people in the wilderness\" = 3510 (13x270; or 13x6x45; or 13x33x10) Revelation 9:11l     The whole verse = 12090 (13x930) l     The locusts = 351 (13x33) l     \"They have a king, the angel of the abyss\" = 3978 (13x306) Ephesians 2:2l     \"According to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air\" = 9178* (13x706) l     \"The power of the air\" = 2600 (13x200) * Ninety-one hundred being 13x700; and 78 being 13x6. Luke 10:18l     \"Lightning from heaven\" = 2626 (13x202) l     \"And He said, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven\" = 6903 (13x531) Ephesians 6:12l     \"But against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this \nworld, against spiritual wickedness in high places\" = 16211 (13x1247) Matthew 16:23l     \"An offence unto me\" (skandalon mou) = 936 (13x72)   THE HUMAN ADVERSARIESpresent the same peculiar phenomena: l     Asshur = 169 (132)* l     \"The man of sin\" = 13062 (133x6) l     \"The man who took not God for his strength\" = 2197 (133)** * Nimrod exhibits a number connected with Antichrist, being 294, or 7x42. ** The whole of Psalm 52 = 19572 (42x466).   THE BOOK OF ESTHERreveals the same law in operation. Having diligently cast the horoscope (as Pur, rw@p means: see Isa 47:13), Haman found the most favourable time for carrying out his designs as \"the Jews' \nenemy.\"* * A term applied to none but Haman. See Esth 3:10, 7:6, 8:1, 9:10,14. Esther 3:7 tells us that for 12 months the horoscope was consulted \"in the first of the month...\nfrom day to day, and from month to month, to the twelfth month.\" Then (v 12) on the thirteenth \nday of the first month (i.e., the thirteenth month from the time they commenced) the favourable \nday was found. Then (3:13) the letters were prepared, and upon \"one day, even upon the \nthirteenth day of the twelfth month\" (at the end of the second year), the Jews were all to be put \nto death. On that day came the deliverance (8:12, etc.). Thus we have three thirteens connected \nwith this gigantic effort of the great enemy to destroy the Lord's people, and with them, of \ncourse, the promised seed. This is the ultimate object of the great enemy in all his designs \nagainst God's people. On the other hand, we see the multiples of the dominical eight in the Lord's people: Mordecai 274 Son of Jair 273 Son of Shimei 472 son of Kish 462 Benjamite 431 (8x239) 1912     Eth-Hadassah 475 That is Esther 677 (8122) 1152     (8x42) Purim 336 On the other hand we have: l     Bigthan 455 (13x35) l     Haman the Agagite 117 (13x9) l     Zeresh (his wife) 507 (13x13x3) Haman's sons present a curious phenomenon. In every Hebrew manuscript these names are presented thus (9:7-9): and (v'eth) Parshandatha and (v'eth) Dalphon and (v'eth) Aspatha and (v'eth) Poratha and (v'eth) Adalia and (v'eth) Aridatha and (v'eth) Parmashta and (v'eth) Arisai and (v'eth) Aridai and (v'eth) Vajezatha This peculiarity has been preserved not only in all the manuscripts, but in every printed edition of the Hebrew Text. No scribe or editor has ventured to change this form of their presentation. Various conjectures have been made both by the ancient Jewish and modern commentators as to the reason why these names are always presented thus; but no one seems to have looked upon \nthe names as an addition sum (regarding of course each letter as a figure). Treated thus the sum \nof the names amounts to 10244 or 13x788. The whole family is 10868 or 13x836.   THE ADVERSARIES OF CHRISTl     \"The Scribes\" = 780 (13x60) l     \"The Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites\" = 2704 (132x16) l     \"Woe!\" = 481 (13x37) l     \"Leaven of Pharisees and Sadducees\" = 3718 (132x22) l     \"A wicked and adulterous generation\" = 1365 (13x105) The Scriptures concerning Barabbasl     Matt 27:20: \"But the chief priests and elders persuaded the people that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus\" = 10127 (13x779) m     The elders = 1352 (13x104) m     The multitude = 2340 (13x180) l     Matt 27:16: \"And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas\" = 2743 (13x211) l     Mark 15:6: \"Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they \ndesired\" = 910 (13x70) l     Luke 23:18: \"And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man, and release \nunto us Barabbas\" = 9347 (13x719) l     John 18:40: \"Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas.

A few miscellaneous examples must suffice:-- l     In Gen 10 we have the scattering of the nations, and their division through the earth. It \nhappened in the days of Peleg, the gematria of whose name is one hundred and thirteen. \nThe Scripture recording it (Gen 10:25-29) = 10647 (13x63) l     Salah (Peleg's grandfather) was 338 (132x2) l     When Uzziah apostatised (2 Chron 26) it was after he had reigned 52 years (4x13) l     Jeroboam II had 40 years of prosperity, and then 12 of apostasy = 52 (4x13) l     Joash reigned 39 years (3x13), and then apostatised (2 Chron 23, 24) l     In the 13th year of Josiah, Jeremiah began to prophesy against the apostasy of Judah. l     Cain has no chronology, and Saul has none, except the last year, which was the first of \nDavid's, and of which 13 is a factor. l     Solomon was 13 years building his own house, which was so full of apostasy. (But he \nwas 7 years building the LORD's house.) The Number of those who died in Korah's Rebellionwas 250 + 14700 = 14950 (13x1150). See Num 16:35,49. The Valley of Hinnom(or of the son or children of Hinnom) occurs 13 times. It was the scene of the idolatrous and \ninhuman rites of Moloch introduced by Solomon (1 Kings 11:7). The casting of children into the \nfire in that valley made it the fit symbol of the future punishment of sinners, who are to be cast \ninto the lake of fire, and gave rise to the word Gehenna, from the Hebrew Mn$@hi )ygi Gee-\nHinnom, Valley of Hinnom. The 13 occurrences, which contain the whole history of the valley, \nare worthy of connected study (Josh 15:8,18, 18:16, twice; 2 Kings 23:10; 2 Chron 28:3, 33:6; \nNeh 11:30; Jer 7:31,32, 19:2,6, 32:35). Thus the two numbers 8 and 13 are like two threads--gold and crimson--which run through the whole of Divine Revelation, continually crossing and recrossing each other. There is, however, one very important branch of this part of our subject still remaining, and that is:--   THE CONNECTION OF THE NUMBER THIRTEEN WITH SUBSTITUTION AND ATONEMENTThe Saviour, though without sin, was \"made sin,\" or a sin-offering, for His people. He was \"wounded for our transgressions,\" and bruised for their iniquities. He was, in fact, \n\"NUMBERED WITH THE TRANSGRESSORS\" (Isa 53:12). Therefore this number is not only the all-pervading factor of SIN, but also of sin's atonement. It is not only the number which brands the sinner as a rebel against God, but it is the number \nborne by the sinner's Substitute. His very names in the Old Testament, before the work of Atonement was entered on or accomplished, are all multiples of 13, just as His names, afterwards in the New Testament and \nwhen the work of Atonement was carried out, are all multiples of 8. l     Christ 1480 (8x185) l     Lord 800 (8x100) l     Our Lord 1768 (8x221) l     Saviour 1408 (8x8x22) l     Emmanuel 25600 (8x8x8x50) l     Messiah 656 (8x82) l     Son 880 (8x110) The Old Testament names are:-- l     Jehovah = 26 (13x2) l     Adonai = 65 (13x5) l     Ha-Elohim = 91 (13x7) l     Messiah, as given in Psalm 2, a form in which it occurs 10 times, \"His Anointed\" = 364 \n(13x28)--the very number of Satan himself. But note here the marvellous combination of the other factors, 2, 5, and 7, the significance of \nwhich we need not dwell upon after all that we have said about them as indicating incarnation, \ngrace, and spiritual perfection. Truly, it is written, \"Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree.\" Hence the numerical value of the very word \"anathema\", curse, is 546 (13x42), and it occurs 6 times. Genesis 4:4which records the first type of this Lamb of God, the sinner's substitute, exhibits the number 13. l     \"And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock, and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and his offering.\" The verse amounts to 2093 (13x161). l     Verse 7, where we have a further reference to this offering = 5421 (13x3x139) Abel suffered; Cain sinned; Seth was the substitute for Abel. Hence the three names are: Abel 37 Cain 160 Seth 700 (13x69) 897 Their whole history (Gen 4:1-25) amounts to 76882 (13x5914). Leviticus 16The great chapter on Atonement is most remarkable. We cannot give the whole chapter; but note-- l     Verses 2-4, which describe Aaron's preparations = 15015 (13x5x7x33) l     Verses 5-11, the choosing of the victims, down to the sacrificing of the bullock = 24739 \n(13x1903) l     Verses 12-14, the burning of the sweet incense, and the seven-fold sprinkling of the blood before the mercy-seat = 13377 (13x3x73). With this we may compare the words in Eph 5:25,26, \"And gave Himself for it, that He might sanctify it\" = 4459 (13x7) l     Verses 15,16, the atonement of the holy place = 13637 (13x1049) l     Verses 17-34, the high priest entering alone, ending with the everlasting statute = \n80613 (132x32x53) l     Verses 20-23, the scape-goat's dismissal = 20670 (13x5x6x53) l     Verses 24-27, the purification of the priest and his assistants = 18993 (13x3x487) l     The latter two together (verses 20-27) = 39663 (13x33x113) l     The scape-goat = 585 (13x45) l     Verse 20, the choosing of the goat = 3575 (13x5x55) l     Verses 21-23, the driving of the goat = 17095 (13x1315) l     Verses 24-27, the rest of the atonement = 18993 (3x13x487) Numbers 21:8,9It may be observed that the serpent (Ha-Seraph) is also 585, exactly the same number as the scape-goat. l     Verses 6,7, which speak of the sin, the judgment, and the prayer = 7241 (13x557) l     Verse 8 \"And the LORD said unto Moses, make thee a fiery serpent\" = 1664 (8x8x2x13) m     \"And set it upon a pole; and it shall come to pass that every one that is bitten\" \n= 1430 (13x110) l     Verses 8,9 = 8886 John 3:14l     The Lord's own reference to Num 21 = 2366 (132x14) Isaacwho was the type of Christ in substitution, has, as the factor of his name, 13 as well as 8. It is 208 (13x8x2). Isaac's history, too, in Gen 22:1-19 (the eighth of the Divine interviews and covenants), amounts to 54808, or (13x8x17x31). The Sacrifice of Job for his Friendsl     Job 42:8 = 6721 (13x517) The Atonement after Korah's RebellionNumbers 16, \"When Aaron stood between the living and the dead.\" l     Verses 45-47 = 8138 (13x2x313) l     Verses 45-50 = 20501 (13x19x83) Isaiah 53l     Verses 2-4 = 7995 (13x15x41) l     Verses 1-5 = 13286 (13x1022) l     Verses 6-8 = 8749 (13x673) l     52:14-53:10 = 36582 (13x42x67) l     52:1-12 also equals 36582. Thus the lifting up of the voice of joy in Zion, and the lifting \nup of the Son of Man, present the very same number. l     52 and 53 = 84123 (13x9x719) Isaiah 7:7-16l     Verse 7 = 1391 (13x107) l     Verse 8 \"Damascus\" = 444 l     Verse 9 = 4017 (13x309) The Day of Atonementl     Lev 23:26,27 = 6526 (13x502) l     Lev 23:27,28 = 5187 (3x13x133) Daniel 9:25-27l     The three verses = 21164 (13x4x407), or (13x1628) l     \"Abomination of desolation\" = 966 (42x23) l     \"Abomination\" = 546 (42x13) l     \"Desolation\" = 420 (42x10) l     Verse 26 Messiah shall be cut off = 988 (13x76) l     Verse 25 \"Unto Messiah\" = 432 (2x8x33). l     Verse 25 \"Messiah the Prince\" = 425 (52x17) l     Verse 24 \"To anoint the most holy\" = 1242 l     Verse 24 \"The most holy\" = 858 (13x66) l     The entire prophecy = 43554 (42x17x61) Compare Matt 24:15 in the Greek: l     \"Abomination\" = 855 (9x19x5) l     \"Desolation\" = 2158 (13x166) l     While the phrase \"abomination of desolation\" = 2666, the whole quotation, \"the abomination of desolation spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place\" \n= 9373 (13x721) 1 Corinthians 15:3l     \"Christ died for our sins\" = 5616 (13x8x2x33) 2 Corinthians 5:17-21l     The whole passage is 53365, or (13x4105) John 23:31,32l     \"Now is the Son of Man glorified\" = 3887 (132x23) l     \"God is glorified in Him\" = 2197 (133) l     \"God shall glorify Him in Himself\" = 3016 (13x8x29) Romans 6:6-8l     Verse 6 \"He died for the ungodly\" =1794 (13x6x23) l     Verse 8 \"We being sinners\" = 4290 (13x330) l     Verse 9 \"Being justified now by His blood\" = 4602 (13x3x118) l     Verse 9 \"From wrath\" = 1040 (13x80) l     Verse 9 \"through whom we have now received the atonement\" = 1989 (13x153) 1 Corinthians 2:2l     \"Him crucified\" = 3211 (132x19) Galatians 6:14l     \"But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world\" = 16367 (13x1259) Philippians 2l     Verse 8 \"Obedient unto death, even the death of the cross\" = 4745 (13x5x73) m     Whole of verse 8 = 11804 (13x908) l     Verse 7 \"He made Himself of no reputation\" = 1911 (13x3x72) l     Verse 7 \"The form of a servant\" = 1742 (13x134) l     Verses 5-9 = 42328 (13x8x407) Colossians 2:14,15l     The whole verses = 22282 (13x1714) l     \"Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us\" = 4407 (13x3x113) l     \"Which was contrary to us, even it He took out of the way, nailing it to His cross; and \nhaving spoiled principalities and powers\" = 13065 (13000+5x13) l     \"He made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it\" = 5018 (13x386) Turning once more to the number eight, it is remarkable that:--   THE RISEN CHRISTwas seen by 512 persons. And 512 is the cube of 8 (83).   THE NUMBER OF THE DISCIPLESgathered in the upper room (Acts 1:15) was 120 (8x15).   1 PETER 3l     Verse 20 \"A few...were saved\" = 1480 the number of \"Christos\" CristoV; \"that is eight souls\" = 4536. Total 6016 (82x84) On the other hand we have:-- l     \"The days of Noah\" = 1209 (13x31x3) l     Verse 22 \"Who is on the right hand of God\" = 2224 (8x278)   LUKE 1:35l     The angel's words = 5688 (8x711) l     \"Nazareth,\" the scene of the Annunciation = 464 (8x58) l     But \"Jesus of Nazareth\" = 2197 (133)   EIGHT IN THE APOCALYPSEWe see not only the number seven stamping the book throughout with spiritual perfection, but as it contains also the history which leads up to resurrection and the new heavens and earth, the \nnumber eight is also seen. l     There are 24 elders (3x8) l     Four beasts, each with six wings = 24 (3x8) l     Twelve thousand from each tribe, 12000 = (8x15x100) l     144000 for all the tribes = 82x152x10; the same number of virgins who follow the Lamb l     1600 furlongs, the measure of the winepress (8x8x25), or (82x52) l     The 1000 years (8x125) l     The 12000 cubits' length of the \"four-square\" city (8x15x100)   THE NUMBER OF OCCURRENCESof the word zumh (zumee), \"leaven,\" in the New Testament is thirteen, and it is significant of its \nconnection with corruption, as denoting apostasy from the truth. It is surely impossible to explain all this evidence on the doctrine of chances. There must be design. And design so perfect, so uniform, so significant can only be Divine. And being Divine is \nan unanswerable argument in favour of the verbal and even literal inspiration of the Scriptures \nof Truth.   Back | Contents | Next    Back | Contents | Next PART II ITS SPIRITUAL SIGNIFICANCE NINEThe number nine is a most remarkable number in many respects. It is held in great reverence by all who study the occult sciences; and in mathematical science it possesses properties and \npowers which are found in no other number.* * Among others may be mentioned (1) that the sum of the digits which form its \nmultiples are themselves always a multiple of nine; e.g., 2 x 9 = 18 (and 1+8=9); 3 x 9 \n= 27 (and 2+7=9); 4 x 9 = 36 (and 3+6=9); 5 x 9 = 45 (and 4+5=9), etc., etc.; and so \nwith the larger numbers: 52843 x 9 = 475587 (and 4+7+5+5+8+7=36, and 3+6=9). (2) The sum of its multiples through the nine digits = 405, or 9 times 45. It is the last of the digits, and thus marks the end; and is significant of the conclusion of a matter. It is akin to the number six, six being the sum of its factors (3x3=9, and 3+3=6), and is thus significant of the end of man, and the summation of all man's works. Nine is, therefore,   THE NUMBER OF FINALITY OR JUDGMENT,for judgment is committed unto Jesus as \"the Son of man\" (John 5:27; Acts 17:31). It marks the completeness, the end and issue of all things as to man\u0160the judgment of man and all his works. It is a factor of 666, which is 9 times 74. The gematria of the word \"Dan,\" which means a judge, is 54 (9x6). \"th orgh mou\" (tee orgee mou), my wrath, = 999 (Heb 3:11). The solemn amhn (ameen), amen, or \"verily,\" of our Lord, amounts also to 99, summing up and ending His words. The sum of the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet is 4995 (5x999). It is stamped, therefore, with the numbers of grace and finality. The sum of the Greek alphabet is 3999.   THE FIRST CONTEST (Gen 14)is a battle between the 4 kings and 5 (=9).* * The Gematria of verses 3 and 4, Gen 14, which describe the rebellion and the battle, is 5655 (13x435). And verses 4 and 5, which describe the coming of the four kings, = \n5590 (13x430). Thus the rebellion verse binds the war and its cause together. Verse 9, also, which describes the battle, is 4732 (132x28).The swift vengeance of Abram, verses 13-16, = 10738 (13x7x118). The standing of Abram before Melchisedech = 19019 (13x7x11x19). Thus with Abram we find not only the 13, but 7 marking the spiritual character of himself and his mission.   SODOMGenesis 19, recording the judgment of Sodom, is marked by multiples of nine. Verses 4-29 amount to 89550 (9x9950, or 9x50x199). The same is seen if we divide it into sections:\u0160 l     Verses 4-18. From the riot in Sodom to Lot's plea for Zoar is 50733 (9x3x1879). l     Verses 19-25. From Lot's plea to the overthrow is 24543 (9x9x303). l     Verses 26-29. From \"Lot's wife\" to the end of the history is 14274 (9x2x13x61).* * It is interesting to note that in the midst of all this, the words \nwhich refer to the deliverance of Lot, \"Haste thee\" (v 22) to \"out of \nthe midst\" (v 29), give a multiple of 8, the Dominical Number; it is \n25304 (8x3163); while four of the verses of this section (25-28) are \neach separately multiples of 8; their total sum being 11312 (8x1414). The sum of the whole chapter is a multiple of 13. We see the same phenomena in the account as given in the Second Epistle of St. Peter. As we do also in the judgment pronounced upon Jerusalem.   THE SIEGES OF JERUSALEMhave been 27 in number, or three times nine, and they are stamped with the number of Divine completeness (3) and the number of judgment (9). As the significance of other numbers is involved and illustrated in these 27, we give a complete list of all Jerusalem's sieges. 1. By the children of Judah against the Jebusites (Judg 1:8) about 1425 BC, and as this is the first, we may note the solemn words which so vividly stamp, from the first, what was to be the \nafter history of the city,\u0160\"Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had \ntaken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.\" This was about 1400 \nBC, or 700 years before Rome was founded. This siege was only partial, for in David's reign we \nstill find the Jebusites occupying the citadel. 2. By David against the Jebusites (2 Sam 5:6-10; 1 Chron 12:23-39), about 1046 BC. 3. By Shishak, king of Egypt, against Rehoboam (2 Chron 12:9; 1 Kings 14:25,26), about 971 BC. To this there was only a feeble resistance, and the Temple was plundered. 4. By the Philistines, Arabians, and Ethiopians against Jehoram (2 Chron 21:16), about 887 BC. In this siege the royal palace was sacked, and the Temple again plundered. 5. By Jehoash, king of Israel, against Amaziah, king of Judah (2 Kings 14:13,14), about 826 BC. The wall was broken down and the city and Temple pillaged. 6. Rezin, king of Syria, and Pekah, king of Israel, against Ahaz (2 Chron 28), about 841 BC. The city held out, but Ahaz sought the aid of Tiglath-Pileser, king of Assyria, who stripped the \nTemple. 7. By Sennacherib, king of Assyria, against Hezekiah (2 Chron 32), about 713 BC. In this case the siege was raised by a Divine interposition, as foretold by Isaiah the prophet. (See the \nsignificance of this No. below.) 8. Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, against Jehoiakim (2 Chron 36:7), about 606 BC, when the Temple was partly pillaged. 9. By Nebuchadnezzar again, against Jehoiachin (2 Chron 36:10), about 599 BC, when the pillage of the Temple was completed and 10,000 people carried away. 10. By Nebuchadnezzar, BC 590-585, against Zedekiah (2 Chron 36:17-20), when the overthrow was complete, the Temple burnt with fire,* and the city lay desolate for 50 years. \nAfter some 58 years, it was again besieged. * It was in the ninth year of Nebuchadnezzar that the House of God was burnt; and on \nthe ninth day of the fourth month that the famine prevailed (2 Kings 25). It may be \nnoted also here, that it was in the ninth year of Hosea that the king of Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away (2 Kings 17:6). 11. By Ptolemy Soter, king of Egypt, against the Jews (320 BC). More than 100,000 captives were taken to Egypt.* * Where the Septuagint Version was afterwards made for Philadelphus, the successor of Ptolemy Soter. 12. By Antiochus the Great, about 203 BC. 13. By Scopus, a general of Alexander, about 199 BC, who left a garrison. 14. By Antiochus again, 168 BC, the worst siege since No. 10. The whole city was pillaged, 10,000 captives taken, the walls were destroyed, the altar was defiled, ancient manuscripts \nperished, the finest buildings were burned, and the Jews were forbidden to worship there. This \nwas the Preteritist fulfillment of Daniel's prophecy (9 and 11), and a foreshadowing example of \nwhat the Futurist fulfillment will yet be. 15. By Antiochus again, about 162 BC, against Judas Maccabaeus. This time honourable terms were made, and certain privileges were secured. 16. By Antiochus Sidetes, king of Syria, against John Hyrcanus, about 135 BC. 17. By Hyrcanus (son of Alex. Jannaeus) and the Priest Aristobulus. The siege was raised by Scaurus, one of Pompey's lieutenants, about 65 BC. 18. By Pompey, against Aristobulus, about 63 BC. The machines were moved on the Sabbath, when the Jews made no resistance. Only thus was it then reduced; 12,000 Jews were slain. 19.* Herod with a Roman army besieged the city in 39 BC for five months. * Antigonus, son of Aristobulus, with a Parthian army took the city in 40 BC; but there was no siege, the city was taken by a sudden surprise. 20. By Titus AD 70. At this memorable siege the conquest was complete. The Second Temple (Herod's) was burnt (in spite of Titus' orders). The tenth legion was left to carry out the work of \ndestruction, and for another 50 years the city again disappears from history, as it did after the \ntenth siege. 21. The Romans had again to besiege the city in 135 AD against the false Messiah, Bar-Cochebas, who had acquired possession of the ruins. Not much is known of this, perhaps the \nmost awful of all the sieges. So great and severe was the struggle, that Hadrian, in announcing to \nthe Roman Senate the conclusion of the war, refrained from using the usual congratulatory \nphrase. The city was now obliterated. Its very name was changed, and it was renamed Aelia \nCapitolinus. A Temple was erected to Jupiter, and a statue of Hadrian placed on the site of the \nHoly of Holies. For 200 years the city passed out of history, no Jews being permitted to \napproach it.* * So great was the relief which Rome experienced by this suppression of Jerusalem \nand the Jews, that the toast became common at Roman feasts, \"Hierosolyma Est \nPerdita,\" \"Jerusalem is destroyed,\" the guests immediately greeting it with the shout \nHurrah. This is the origin of our \"Hep! Hep! Hurrah,\" H, E, P, being the abbreviation \nof the three words, formed by their initial letters (on the principle known as Notarica, or Notricon). To this day Hep or Hip is said by only one person, the rest joining in the shout which greets it! This siege was foretold by our Lord in Luke 19:43, 44 and 21:20-24. 22. After 400 years of so-called Christian colonization, Chosroes the Persian (about 559 AD) swept through the country; thousands were massacred, and the church of the Holy Sepulchre \nwas destroyed. The Emperor Heraclius afterwards defeated him, and restored the city and the \nchurch. 23. The Caliph Omar, in 636-7 AD, besieged the city against Heraclius, and after a feeble resistance, followed by capitulation on favourable terms, the city passed into the hands of the \nTurks, thus marking one of the most important events connected with it and with chronology.* * See The Witness of the Stars, by the same author. 24. Afdal, the Vizier of the Caliph of Egypt, besieged the two rival factions of Moslems, and \npillaged the city in 1098. 25. In 1099 it was besieged by the army of the first Crusade. 26. In 1187 it was besieged by Saladin for seven weeks. 27. The wild Kharezmian hordes, in 1244, captured and plundered the city, slaughtering the monks and priests.   It seemed necessary to give this brief outline, because of several points which arise out of it. The list was made, in the first instance, without any reference whatever to \"Number in Scripture.\" It \nwas not till some time after, in considering the number nine as the number of judgment, that we \nnoted the fact, that the number of these sieges was 27, or three times nine, and thus we saw the \nsignificance of the number. Then, without looking at the list, we anticipated that there would be something peculiar about the numbers 10 and 20, ten being the number of ordinal perfection, and marking some cycle of \ncompleteness. So it proved on examination, for both the tenth and twentieth sieges were marked \nby the destruction of the Temple by fire! The tenth witnessed the destruction of Solomon's \nTemple by Nebuchadnezzar; the twentieth saw the destruction of Herod's Temple under Titus! It was next felt that seven being the number of spiritual perfection, there would be something to mark off the seventh, fourteenth, and twenty-first sieges from all the others, and to connect them \nin some way with the perfection of Divine Revelation. So it proved on examination. These three \nwere each the subject of Divine Prophecy! The seventh in 2 Chronicles 32; the fourteenth in \nDaniel 11; the Twenty-first in Luke 19:43, 44. And there is a siege yet future\u0160a twenty-eighth \nsiege\u0160 which is also foretold in Scripture (see Zech 14, etc.). These four form an epanodos, the \nfirst corresponding to the fourth (the first and fourth sieges in each case being raised by Divine interposition); while the second corresponds to the third in the terrible character of each, thus: A. The 7th\u0160Sennacherib. The siege raised by a miraculous interposition by an angel from heaven. (2 Chron 32)B. The 14th\u0160 Antiochus (Dan 11)\u0160one of the most awful. B. The 21st\u0160Hadrian (Luke 19:43,44)\u0160one of the most complete. A. The 28th\u0160Antichrist. Yet future. But the siege will be raised by a glorious \ndeliverance, not by an angel, but by the Lord Himself coming from heaven. \n(Zech 14) Thus, four are the subjects of prophecy\u0160the 7th, 14th, 21st, and 28th. Two mark complete cycles\u0160the 10th and 20th, when the Temple was destroyed, each being followed by fifty years of silence. Fourteen (7x2) are recorded in the Scripture. Thirteen are non-Biblical, and are recorded only in profane history. Surely there is something more than chance in the occurrence of these significant numbers. \n  THE JUDGMENTSof God in Haggai 1:11* are enumerated in nine particulars: \"And I called for a drought upon the land, and upon the mountains, \nand upon the corn, \nand upon the new wine, \nand upon the oil, \nand upon that which the ground bringeth forth, \nand upon men, \nand upon cattle, \nand upon all the labour of the hands.\"* Note in this verse an illustration of two figures of language\u0160Zeugma and Polysyndeton. There are nine words used from the root dikh, right or judgment:\u0160 1.  dikh (dikee), right, right proceeding, judgment (Acts 25:15, 28:4; 2 Thess 1:9; Jude 7). 2.  dikaioV (dikaios), right, just as it should be. \n3.  dikaiow (dikaioo), to make dikaioV (No. 2), to account righteous. \n4.  dikaiosunh (dikaiosunee), the state, or quality, or condition of him who is dikaioV (dikaios). 5.  dikaiwV (dikaios), justly, rightly. 6.  dikaiwma (dikaioma), a righteous act or requirement.* 7.  dikaiwsiV (dikaiosis), is the action of the judge in promulgating a decree, in declaring or recognizing a person as dikaioV (Rom 4:25, 5:18). * It is important to distinguish the 10 occurrences of this word, which is variously translated, but which should be thus rendered:\u0160Luke 1:6, righteous ordinance. \nRom 1:32, the righteous sentence of God. \nRom 2:26, the righteous requirement of the Law. \nRom 5:16, righteous acquittal. \nRom 5:18, righteous act. \nRom 8:4, righteous requirement. \nHeb 9:1,10, righteous ordinances. \nRev 15:4, righteous sentence. \nRev 19:8, righteous awards given. The difference between dikaiwma (dikaioma) and dikaiosunh \n(dikaiosunee) points us to the fact that the latter word relates either to the \nquality, attribute, or condition of those acceptable before God, or to God's \nown relative attribute of righteousness; while the former word shows that the \nrighteous requirement of the Law is fulfilled by those who are not under the \nLaw, either for condemnation or a rule of life, but who are, as the apostle was, ennomoV Cristou (ennomos Christou), i.e., under obedience to Christ's commands (see pp. 88,89, and 1 Cor 9:20, RV, where the Apostle distinctly says he was not upo nomon (hupo nomon), i.e., under law-principle, the word law not having the article). The Law condemned every one under it. But \nChristians who realize (subjectively) that they died with Christ and live as \nthose alive from the dead, walking in the Spirit and in the power of Christ, \ncarry out practically (though with many failures, doubtless) the righteous requirement of the Law. 8.  dikasthV (dikastees) is the judge (Luke 12:14; Acts 7:27,35). 9.  dikaiokrisia (dikaiokrisia) is the righteous judgment of the judge (Rom 2:5).   OCCURRENCES OF WORDSThe following words, among others, occur 9 times, and are all connected in some way with judgment:\u0160 l     abussoV (abussos), bottomless pit, or deep. l     asebhV (asebees), ungodly. l     aselgeia (aselgeia), lasciviousness. l     astraph (astrapee), lightning. All calling for, or connected with judgment. Enough has been said to show that the signification of the number nine is judgment, especially divine judgment, and the conclusion of the whole matter so far as man is concerned. But nine is the square of three, and three is the number of Divine perfection, as well as the number peculiar to the Holy Spirit. It is not surprising, therefore, to find that this number \ndenotes finality in divine things. \"Fruit (not fruits) of the Spirit\" comprises nine (32) graces: (1) love, (2) joy, (3) peace, (4) longsuffering, (5) gentleness, (6) goodness, (7) faith, (8) meekness, (9) temperance,* while * It will be noticed that in this fruit of the Spirit \"temperance\" is put last; while in the \"works of the flesh\" (vv 19-21), which are sixteen in number (42, the earth number), \"drunkenness and revellings\" are put last! Truly man's ways are not God's ways, nor God's thoughts man's thoughts (Isa 55:8).  THE GIFTS OF THE SPIRITin 1 Corinthians 12:8-10 are also nine in number, viz:\u0160 The word of wisdom, The word of knowledge, \nFaith, \nHealing, \nThe working of miracles, \nProphecy, \nDiscerning of spirits, \nDivers kinds of tongues, \nThe interpretation of tongues.

Back | Contents | Next  Back | Contents | Next PART II ITS SPIRITUAL SIGNIFICANCE TENIt has been already pointed out that ten is one of the perfect numbers, and signifies the perfection of Divine order, commencing, as it does, an altogether new series of numbers. The \nfirst decade is the representative of the whole numeral system, and originates the system of \ncalculation called \"decimals,\" because the whole system of numeration consists of so many tens, \nof which the first is a type of the whole. Completeness of order, marking the entire round of anything, is, therefore, the ever-present signification of the number ten. It implies that nothing is wanting; that the number and order are \nperfect; that the whole cycle is complete.   NOAHcompleted the antediluvian age in the tenth generation from God. \n  THE TEN COMMANDMENTScontain all that is necessary, and no more than is necessary, both as to their number and their order, while   THE LORD'S PRAYERis completed in ten clauses. * * These clauses have the significance of their respective numbers:\u0160The first, God's sovereignty. The second, Jehovah's manifested Name. \nThe third, the realization of God's kingdom. The fourth first mentions the earth. The fifth, the gift of grace supplying our need. \nThe sixth treats of man's sin. \nThe seventh pleads for spiritual guidance. \nThe eighth pleads for final deliverance from all evil. The ninth sums up the divine glory (32), while The tenth completes the eternal cycles.   THE TITHESrepresent the whole of what was due from man to God, as marking and recognisiing God's claim on the whole.   THE REDEMPTION MONEYwas ten gerahs, and thus was acknowledged both what God claimed, and what man was responsible to give. Now ten gerahs was half a shekel (Exo 30:12-16; Num 3:47). Every male \nthat was numbered, over 20 years of age, must pay this sum and meet God's claim. * * When David numbered the people (2 Sam 24 and 1 Chron 21), this payment was not made and God's claim was not met. Hence the judgment which followed. But the first-born were to pay ten times as much; for when God took the Levites instead of the first-born of Israel, there were found 22,273 first-born males, but only 22,000 Levites. So that \n273 had to pay the ransom money, which amounted to ten times ten gerahs. Thus, though the \nfive shekels looked like a variation, the significance of ten is sustained, for the five shekels were \nten times the \"half shekel.\" (See Numbers 3:12,13,40-51).   THE TEN PLAGUESwere representative of the complete circle of God's judgments on Egypt. Exodus 9:14, \"I will...send all my plagues.\"   ANTICHRIST'S WORLD-POWERis comprised in the ten kingdoms, symbolized by the ten toes on the feet of the image of Nebuchadnezzar's dream (Dan 2:41), and by the ten horns of the fourth beast of Daniel's vision \n(Dan 7:7,20,24, etc.; Rev 12:3, 13:1, 17:3,7,12).   TEN NATIONSimply the whole of the nations which are to be the scene of Abraham's covenant possessions (Gen 15:19).   ABRAHAM'S FAITHwas proved by a completed cycle of ten trials:\u0160 1.  His departure from Haran. 2.  His flight to Egypt from the famine. \n3.  In the seizure of Sarah. \n4.  In his war to rescue Lot. \n5.  In his taking Hagar. \n6.  In his circumcision. \n7.  In the second seizure of Sarah at Gerar. \n8.  In the expulsion of Ishmael. \n9.  In the expulsion of Hagar. 10.  In the offering of Isaac.   THE TEN REBELLIONSof Israel in the wilderness (Num 14:22) mark the completed series of Israel's perversities.   THE SILVER SOCKETSwhich formed the foundation of the Tabernacle were 10 x 10 (Exo 38:27). These were made of silver, and silver is significant of redemption (1 Peter 1:18,19). * * Ten also completed the number of the curtains (Exo 26:1).   FIRE CAME DOWN FROM HEAVENten times, six of which were in judgment:\u0160 1.  Genesis 19:24, on Sodom. 2.  Leviticus 9:24, on the first offerings. \n3.  Leviticus 10:2, on Nadab and Abihu. \n4.  Numbers 11:1, on the murmurers at Taberah. \n5.  Numbers 16:35, on Korah and his company. \n6.  1 Kings 18:38, on Elijah's offering at Carmel. \n7.  2 Kings 1:10, on Elijah's enemies. \n8.  2 Kings 1:12, on Elijah's enemies. \n9.  1 Chronicles 21:26, on David's sacrifice. 10.  2 Chronicles 7:1, on Solomon's sacrifice.   TEN TIMES THE PEOPLE SHOUTED FOR JOY1.  Leviticus 9:24, when the fire from heaven consumed the first sacrifices. \n2.  Joshua 6:20, at the taking of Jericho. \n3.  1 Samuel 4:5, when the Ark was brought into the camp. \n4.  1 Samuel 10:24, when Saul was chosen king. \n5.  1 Samuel 17:20, when Israel went to fight the Philistines. \n6.  1 Samuel 17:52, when pursuing them. \n7.  2 Samuel 6:15 (1 Chron 15:28), when the Ark was brought back from the house of Obed-edom. 8.  2 Chronicles 13:15, when God smote Jeroboam before Abijah. \n9.  2 Chronicles 15:14, when Asa and the people heard Oded's prophecy. 10.  Ezra 3:11, when the foundation of the second Temple was laid.   THE TEN VIRGINSrepresent the whole of the nation of Israel (as distinct from the elect remnant, which is the \nBride); * while the five denotes those who by grace will be able to say, \"This is our God, we \nhave waited for Him.\" * The popular interpretation of this parable cannot be the correct one, for we cannot, \nin one parable, take two totally different classes of persons as representing one and the \nsame person. It is impossible to take the Church as represented by both the Ten \nVirgins and the Bride! If the Church is the Bride, then it cannot be the Virgins. If the \nChurch is represented by the Ten Virgins, then it cannot be the Bride. The only escape \nfrom the dilemma is not to read into the Gospel of Matthew that which was the subject \nof a subsequent revelation (Rom 16:25,26; Eph 3:1-11; Col 1:26,27); but to interpret \nMatthew by what was already the subject of previous revelation in the Old Testament about the Bride.   GOD'S RIGHTEOUS CURSESare completed in a series of ten:\u0160 1.  Genesis 3:14, 15, on the serpent. 2.  Genesis 3:17, the ground. \n3.  Genesis 4:11, Cain. \n4.  Genesis 9:25, Cainan. \n5.  Joshua 6:17, Jericho. \n6.  Joshua 6:28, Achan, Joshua 7:12, Achan. \n7.  Joshua 9:23, Gibeonites. \n8.  Judges 9:57, Shechemites. \n9.  1 Kings 16:34, Hiel the Bethelite. 10.  Mark 11:21, The Fig-tree.   \"I HAVE SINNED.\"Ten * persons complete the series of those who uttered this confession, and acknowledged their \ndesert of divine judgment:\u0160 * Of these ten, six were individual (the number of man), while four were on behalf of the nation\u0160\"We.\" 1.  Pharaoh, Exodus 9:27, 10:16. 2.  Balaam, Numbers 22:34. \n3.  Achan, Joshua 7:20. \n4.  Saul, 1 Samuel 15:24,30, 26:21. \n5.  David, 2 Samuel 12:13, 24:10,17; 1 Chronicles 21:8,17; Psa 41:4, 51:4. \n6.  Shimei, 2 Samuel 19:20. \n7.  Hezekiah, 2 Kings 18:14 (rendered \"offended\"). \n8.  Job 7:20. \n9.  Micah 7:9. 10.  Nehemiah 1:6.   THE TABERNACLEis spoken of ten times as the \"Tabernacle of Witness,\" or \"Tabernacle of Testimony.\" Of these, \nfive are Nk@#:$mi mish-kahn, Exodus 38:21; Numbers 1:50,53 (twice), 10:11. This has special \nreference to the Tabernacle as the dwelling-place of God, from Nka#$af shahcan, \"to dwell.\" \nMish-kahn means the dwelling-place of God (Exo 25:8), and is therefore never used by the Holy \nSpirit of \"whole congregation.\" The other five are lhe)& oh-el, Numbers 17:7,8,10, 18:2; 2 Chronicles 24:6. Oh-el means simply a tent, and has special reference to the meeting-place of the people by appointment or at appointed seasons. This is the word which is used by the Holy Spirit of the \"tent of the congregation.\"   THE TEN WORDS OF PSALM 119complete the cycle of the Divine description of His Word. One or other of these ten words occurs in every verse (except 122), viz., Way, Testimony, Precepts, Commandments, Laying, \nLaw, Judgment, Righteousness, Statutes, Word. These, the Massorah says, \"correspond to the \nTen Commandments.\"   THE TENTH GENERATIONcompleted and represented the whole existence of the family or nation. In Deuteronomy 23:3 we read that \"an Ammonite or Moabite shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD; even to \ntheir tenth generation shall they not enter into the congregation of the LORD for ever.\" The \nreason is given in verses 4 and 5. See also Nehemiah 13:1.   THE PARABLES OF THE KINGDOMare ten in number in the Gospel of Matthew. Seven in chapter 13, and three in chapters 22 and 25.   THE UNRIGHTEOUS WHO SHALL NOT ENTERthe kingdom of God are enumerated in ten particulars (1 Cor 6:9,10). \n  THE SECURITY OF THE SAINTSis set forth in a ten-fold enumeration, which completes the whole cycle of assurance to all who are \"in Christ,\" Romans 8:38,39. They are given in two fives:\u0160 \"For I am persuaded, that \nneither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers; nor things present, nor things \nto come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature.\"   THE TEN I AM'S OF JESUS IN JOHN1.  \"I am the Bread of Life\" (6:35). 2.  \"I am the Bread of Life which came down from heaven\" (6:41). \n3.  \"I am the Living Bread\" (6:51). \n4.  \"I am the Light of the world\" (8:12). \n5.  \"I am One that bear witness of Myself\" (8:18). \n6.  \"I am the Door of the sheep\" (10:7,9). \n7.  \"I am the Good Shepherd\" (10:14). \n8.  \"I am the Resurrection and the Life\" (14:6). \n9.  \"I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life\" (14:6). 10.  \"I am the True Vine\" (15:1,5).   THE REPEATED NAMESTen completes the perfect cycle of the repeated Names. Moreover we shall note that these are \ndivided significantly. Of these ten, seven are spoken directly to individual human beings, while \nthree are spoken by the Lord in different connections. Of these seven, four are in the Old \nTestament, and three are in the New Testament. 1.  Abraham, Abraham, Genesis 22:11. \n2.  Jacob, Jacob, Genesis 46:2. \n3.  Moses, Moses, Exodus 3:4. \n4.  Samuel, Samuel, 1 Samuel 3:10. \n5.  Martha, Martha, Luke 10:41. \n6.  Simon, Simon, Luke 22:31. \n7.  Saul, Saul, Acts 9:4. \n8.  Lord, Lord, Matthew 7:21,22, 25:11; Luke 6:46; 13:25. \n9.

Back | Contents | Next    Back | Contents | Next PART II ITS SPIRITUAL SIGNIFICANCE ELEVENIf ten is the number which marks the perfection of Divine order, then eleven is an addition to it, subversive of and undoing that order. If twelve is the number which marks the perfection of \nDivine government, then eleven falls short of it. So that whether we regard it as being 10 + 1, or \n12 - 1, it is the number which marks, disorder, disorganization, imperfection, and \ndisintegration. There is not much concerning it in the Word of God, but what there is is significant, especially as a factor.   THE DUKES OF EDOMwere eleven in number (Gen 36:40-43), and Edom, though closely related to Israel, was different from it in order and government, while the bitterest hatred existed between them. The \nword for \"Duke\" is a multiple of 13.   THE ELEVEN SONS OF JACOBtold of the disintegration and disorganization in Jacob's family, which made it possible for it to be said \"one is not.\"   FROM HOREB TO KADESH BARNEAwas a journey of eleven days (Deut 1:2). One more day would have carried them to the complete administration of all those wonderful laws which God had given them.   ELI, HOPHNI, AND PHINEHAShave for their gematria the number 462, the factors of which are 11 and 42; both significant of the disorder in Eli's house, and of disintegration in Israel.   JEHOIAKIM REIGNED ELEVEN YEARSwhen Nebuchadnezzar came up and began his disintegrating work on Jerusalem (2 Kings 23:36, 34:1; 2 Chron 36:5,6).   ZEDEKIAH REIGNED ELEVEN YEARSwhen Nebuchadnezzar completed the work by putting an end to Israel's rule in Jerusalem (2 Chron 36:11; Jer 52:1), for \"in the eleventh year the city was broken up\" (Jer 39:2).   THE ELEVENTH YEARin which Ezekiel prophesied against Tyre (Eze 26:1) and against Egypt (30:20 and 31:1) was the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in which Jerusalem was broken up. And the threefold repetition of \nit is to impress us with the fact that Tyre and Egypt should be broken up, as Jerusalem had been.   THE ELEVEN APOSTLESwitness of disintegration even amongst the Twelve (Acts 2:14, etc.); while \n  THE ELEVENTH HOUR(Matt 20:6,9) is proverbial as being contrary alike both to what is right in order and arrangement.   THE LIFE OF OUR LORD ON EARTHwas about 33 years (3 x 11), and then He was \"cut off,\" and \"we see not yet all things put under Him\" (Dan 9:26; Heb 2:8).   ELEVEN HUNDREDoccurs only twice, both referring to days of defective administration, marked by the fact that there was \"no king\":-- l     Judges 16:5, the Philistine bribe which deprived Israel of their mighty judge and \ndeliverer, Samson. l     Judges 17:2, etc., connected with the introduction of idolatry into Israel, which brought \nwith it trouble and disintegration; added to God's order and ordinances for them; and \nin the end caused the ruin and loss of all government. Dan and Ephraim were the two offending tribes, for Micah, who made the image with the eleven \nhundred shekels, was an Ephraimite, and the tribe that stole it and his priest was the Tribe of \nDan. Both are omitted from the tribes in Revelation 7, according to the declaration of Jehovah \nin Deuteronomy 29:18-20, that the \"man, woman, family, or tribe\" which should introduce \nidolatry into Israel, \"the LORD shall BLOT OUT HIS NAME.\"   ADDITIONAL MISCELLANEOUS ILLUSTRATIONSEleven kings and rulers offended with God's servants for telling them the truth:\u0160 1.

It is found as a multiple in all that has to do with rule. The sun which \"rules\" the day, and the moon \nand stars which \"govern\" the night, do so by their passage through the twelve signs of the \nZodiac which completes the great circle of the heavens of 360 (12 x 30) degrees or divisions, \nand thus govern the year. Twelve is the product of 3 (the perfectly Divine and heavenly number) and 4 (the earthly, the number of what is material and organic). While seven is composed of 3 added to 4, twelve is 3 multiplied by 4, and hence denotes that which can scarcely be explained in words, but which the spiritual perception can at once \nappreciate, viz., organization, the products denoting production and multiplication and increase \nof all that is contained in the two numbers separately. The 4 is generally prominently seen in the \ntwelve.   THERE WERE TWELVE PATRIARCHSfrom Seth to Noah and his family, and twelve from Shem to Jacob. \n  THE TWELVE SONS OF ISRAELthough actually thirteen in number, there are never more than twelve names in any one list. There are about 18 enumerations altogether, but in each list one or other is omitted. Generally \nit is Levi, but not always. In Revelation 7 both Dan and Ephraim are omitted (see p. 211), but the enumeration is still twelve, Levi and Joseph being introduced for this special sealing of the \nremnant which shall go unscathed through the great tribulation. Then there were twelve Judges or Saviours (see p. 214).   THE TEMPLE OF SOLOMONhas the number twelve as the predominating factor, in contrast with the Tabernacle, which had the number five. This agrees with the grace which shines in the Tabernacle, and with the glory \nof the kingdom which is displayed in the Temple. When we come to the New Testament we find the same great principle pervading the Apostolic government as we see in the Patriarchal and National, for we have: l     The twelve Apostles. l     The twelve foundations in the heavenly Jerusalem. l     The twelve gates. l     The twelve pearls. l     The twelve angels.   THE MEASUREMENT OF THE NEW JERUSALEMwill be 12,000 furlongs square, while the wall will be 144 (12 x 12) cubits, Revelation 21:16,17. The number of the sealed in Revelation 7:4 will be 144,000, and all that has to do with the Twelve Tribes is necessarily pervaded by this number, such as the stones in the High Priest's \nbreastplate, the stones taken out of the Jordan, the number of the spies, etc. etc., and therefore \nwe have not referred to all such reference in these pages.   TWELVE PERSONS WERE ANOINTEDfor government of various kinds. Of course, all kings, priests, prophets, and healed lepers were anointed; but the circumstances of the anointing of twelve individuals is specially recorded. Of \nthese, five were priests (Aaron and his four sons, Exodus 6:23) and seven were kings: 1.  Aaron, Exodus 29:7,9, etc. \n2.  Nadab, Exodus 29:7,9, etc. \n3.  Abihu, Exodus 29:7,9, etc. \n4.  Eleazar, Exodus 29:7,9, etc. \n5.  Ithamar, Exodus 29:7,9, etc. \n6.  Saul, 1 Samuel 10:1. \n7.  David, * 1 Samuel 16:13. \n8.  Absalom, 2 Samuel 19:10. \n9.  Solomon, 1 Kings 1:39. 10.  Jehu, 2 Kings 9:6. \n11.  Joash, 2 Kings 11:12. \n12.  Jehoahaz, 2 Kings 23:30. * David was anointed three times, viz: by Samuel, 1 Samuel 16:13; \nby the men of Judah, 2 Samuel 2:4; by the elders of Israel, 2 Samuel 5:3. It will be observed from the above list that Saul, the man of man's choice, is thus stamped with the number 6. David, the man of God's choice is stamped with the number seven. For Saul and \nDavid are the sixth and seventh respectively in order. The words, \"a man after God's own \nheart,\" mean simply a man of God's choice, and not, as infidels are never tired of asserting, that \nGod approved of all the sins which David fell into.   TWELVE YEARSof age was Jesus when He first appears in public (Luke 2:42) and utters His first-recorded words (see p. 52).   TWELVE LEGIONSof angels mark the perfection of angelic powers (Matt 26:53).   THE HALF OF TWELVEsometimes denotes interruption or defect in human government, while \n  THE NUMBER OF OCCURRENCESof words agrees with its signification, e.g., aulh, aulee, \"palace,\" occurs twelve times.   Back | Contents | Next  Back | Contents | Next PART II ITS SPIRITUAL SIGNIFICANCE THIRTEENThis number has been considered in connection with the number eight, to which the reader is referred (see pages 205-232).   ADDITIONAL MISCELLANEOUS ILLUSTRATIONSThirteen famines are recorded in the Scriptures:\u0160 1.  Genesis 12:10 \n2.  Genesis 26:1 \n3.  Genesis 41:54 \n4.  Ruth 1:1 \n5.  2 Samuel 21:1 \n6.  1 Kings 18:1 \n7.  2 Kings 4:38 \n8.  2 Kings 7:4 \n9.  2 Kings 25:3 10.  Nehemiah 5:3 \n11.  Jeremiah 14:1 \n12.  Luke 15:14 \n13.  Acts 11:28     FOURTEENbeing a multiple of seven, partakes of its significance; and, being double that number, implies a double measure of spiritual perfection. The number two with which it is combined (2x7) may, however, bring its own significance into its meaning, as in Matthew 1, where the genealogy of Jesus Christ is divided up and given in \nsets of 14 (2x7) generations, two being the number associated with incarnation. The same principle may be applied to other multiples of seven, and Bible students can find their own illustrations.   ADDITIONAL MISCELLANEOUS ILLUSTRATIONSFourteen times in the Book of Proverbs the expression occurs \"the fear of the Lord\":\u0160Proverbs 1:7, 29, 2:5, 8:13, 9:10, 10:27, 14:26, 27, 15:16, 33, 16:6, 19:23, 22:4, 23:17.     FIFTEENbeing a multiple of five, partakes of the significance of that number, also of the number three with which it is combined, 3 x 5. Five is, as we have seen, the number of grace, and three is the number of divine perfection. Fifteen, therefore, specially refers to acts wrought by the energy of Divine grace. Deity is seen in it, for the two Hebrew letters which express it are y, Yod (10), and h, Hey (5). These spell the ineffable Name of hy, Jah, who is the fountain of all grace. The number fifteen is \nthus made up, by addition, 10 + 5; but as the Jews would not, by the constant use of these two \nletters, profane the sacred name, two other letters were arbitrarily used for this number, and a \ndifferent and artificial combination was thus formed\u0160+ (Teth) = 9, and w (Vau) = 6. The \nnumber 9 + 6 would thus represent the number fifteen, but without any significance. Fifteen being 8 + 7 as well as 3 x 5, it may also include a reference to resurrection, as being a special mark of the energy of Divine grace issuing in glory. A few examples may suffice: l     The Ark was borne by the Flood fifteen cubits upwards, Genesis 7:20. l     Hezekiah's reprieve from death was fifteen years, 2 Kings 20:6. l     The Jews were delivered from death under Esther on the fifteenth day of the month (9:18,21). This is specially significant, as we have seen (p. 222), that their sentence to death was connected with the number thirteen. l     Bethany, where Lazarus was raised, and from whence the Lord ascended, was fifteen \nfurlongs from Jerusalem, John 11:18. l     Paul's ship anchored safely in fifteen fathoms on the 14th day, after thirteen days of toil \nand trial, Acts 27:21. l     On the fifteenth day of the first month was the feast of unleavened bread, Leviticus 23:6; \nand l     On the fifteenth day of the seventh month was the feast of Tabernacles (v 34).   SEVENTEENstands out very prominently as a significant number. It is not a multiple of any other number, and therefore it has no factors. Hence it is called one of the prime (or indivisible) numbers. \nWhat is more, it is the seventh in the list of the prime numbers. The series runs 1, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, etc. Thirteen, it will be noted, is also a prime number, and is therefore important; but it is the sixth of the series: hence it partakes of the significance of the \nnumber 6, and is indeed an intensified expression of it. In like manner seventeen being the seventh of the series, it partakes of and intensifies the significance of the number seven. Indeed, it is the combination or sum of two perfect \nnumbers\u0160seven and ten\u0160seven being the number of spiritual perfection, and ten of ordinal \nperfection. Contrasted together the significance of these two numbers is clear; and when united in the number seventeen we have a union of their respective meanings, viz., spiritual perfection, plus \nordinal perfection, or the perfection of spiritual order. We see a beautiful illustration in   ROMANS 8:35-39which concludes the first great division of that all-important Epistle, and sums up the blessings of those who are dead and risen in Christ. First we have a series of seven, then a series of ten. \nThe seven are marked off by being put in the form of a question, while the ten are given as the \nanswer to it. \"Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall 1.  Tribulation, 2.  Or distress, \n3.  Or persecution, \n4.  Or famine, \n5.  Or nakedness, \n6.  Or peril, \n7.  Or sword? as it is written, For Thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the \nslaughter. Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him that loved us. For I am persuaded, that, 8.  Neither death (1), 9.  Nor life (2), 10.  Nor angels (3), \n11.  Nor principalities (4), \n12.  Nor things present (5), \n13.  Nor things to come (6), \n14.  Nor powers (7), \n15.  Nor height (8), \n16.  Nor depth (9), \n17.  Nor any other creature (10), shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.\" Thus is set forth the spiritual and eternal perfection of the believer's standing in Christ. \nBy forming the conclusive answer to the question, and giving us the positive assurance (though in a negative form), it seems as though the number ten is of more weight than seven when thus \nused together. It is so in 2 Chronicles 2, where, in verse 7, Solomon sends to Hiram for a \ncunning workman, and seven particulars are specified; and in verse 14 a man is sent and his \nqualifications are enumerated in ten particulars. A more important illustration will be found in   HEBREWS 12:18-24,where the Old Dispensation and the New are thus contrasted: \n\"Ye are not come 1.  Unto the mount that might be touched, 2.  And that burned with fire, \n3.  Nor unto blackness, \n4.  And darkness, \n5.  And tempest, \n6.  And the sound of a trumpet, \n7.  And the voice of words... but ye are come 8.  Unto Mount Zion (1), \n9.  And unto the city of the living God (2). 10.  The heavenly Jerusalem (3), \n11.  And to an innumerable company of angels (4), \n12.  To the general assembly (5), \n13.  And church of the firstborn which are written in heaven (6), 14.  And to God the judge of all (7), 15.  And to the spirits of just men made perfect (8), \n16.  And to Jesus the Mediator of the New Covenant (9), \n17.  And to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of Abel (10).\" Here again the blessings of the New Covenant are seen to be higher than those of the Old, both \nin number and in importance. The Old were spiritual (7), but the latter are more so, for they are \ndoubly the manifestation of Divine grace, ten, or 2 x 5.   PSALM 83:6-11gives us the ten and the seven in a different order. Verses 6-9 give us a confederation of ten enemies for the purpose of making Israel extinct, and \"to cut them off from being a nation\"; \nwhile verses 10 and 12 give us an enumeration of seven enemies which the Lord had destroyed \nin the past, with the prayer that He would do to the confederacy of the ten what He had done to \nthe seven in the past. The commentators agree that no such confederacy can be found in the past history of Israel, so that we are shut up to the conclusion that the Psalm is Proleptic, and speaks of a yet future \nconfederacy of which the later Prophets speak more particularly. Verses 6-9: The ten-fold confederation:\u0160 1.  Edom 2.  The Ishmaelites \n3.  Moab \n4.  The Hagarenes \n5.  Gebal \n6.  Ammon \n7.  Amalek \n8.  The Philistines \n9.  Tyre 10.  Assur (Assyria) Then follow, in verses 10-12, the seven enemies which had been destroyed in days of old: 11.  Midianites (1), Judges 7:8 \n12.  Sisera (2), Judges 4:5, 21 \n13.  Jabin (3), Judges 4:5, 21 \n14.  Oreb (4), Judges 7:25 \n15.  Zeeb (5), Judges 7:25 \n16.  Zebah (6), Judges 8:5 \n17.  Zalmunna (7), Judges 8:5 The number seventeen (not the word merely) has a significance of its own, and therefore an importance which must be taken into account wherever it appears in the Word of God by itself or as a factor. It forms a great factor in the number 153 (see pp. 273,274).   ADDITIONAL MISCELLANEOUS ILLUSTRATIONSSeventeen Angelic appearances are recorded in the Gospels and Acts:\u0160 1-3.

TWENTYis the double of ten, and may in some cases signify its concentrated meaning. But its significance seems rather to be connected with the fact that it is one short of twenty-one, 21 - 1 = 20; that is \nto say, if 21 is the three-fold 7, and signifies Divine (3) completion as regards spiritual \nperfection (7), then twenty, being one short of 21, it would signify what Dr. Milo Mahan calls \nexpectancy, and certainly we are not without illustrations in support of it: l     Twenty years Jacob waited to get possession of his wives and property, Gen 21:38,41. l     Twenty years Israel waited for a deliverer from Jabin's oppression, Judg 4:3. l     Twenty years Israel waited for deliverance through Samson, Judg 15:20, 16:31.

TWENTY-TWObeing the double of eleven, has the significance of that number in an intensified form,\u0160disorganization and disintegration, especially in connection with the Word of God. For \nthe number two is associated with the second person of the Godhead, the living Word. It is associated with the worst of Israel's kings,\u0160Jeroboam (1 Kings 14:20), and Ahab (1 Kings 16:29), each reigning 22 years. Eleven, we have seen, derives its significance by being an addition to Divine order (10), and a subtraction from Divine rule (12). These are two of the three ways in which the written Word of \nGod can be corrupted\u0160the third being alteration. \"The words of the LORD are pure \nwords\"\u0160words pertaining to this world and therefore requiring to be purified (see p. 169). But these words have been altered, taken from, and added to by man. Is there anything in this which \nconnects it with the fact that the letters of the alphabet (Hebrew) are twenty-two in number? \nDoes it point to the fact that the revelation of God in being committed to human language and to \nman's keeping would thereby be subject to disintegration and corruption?   \n  TWENTY-FOURbeing a multiple of twelve, expresses in a higher form the same signification (as 22 does of 11). It is the number associated with the heavenly government and worship, of which the earthly \nform in Israel was only a copy. We are told that both Moses and David ordered all things \nconnected with the Tabernacle and Temple worship by direct revelation from God, and as a \ncopy of things in the heavens, Hebrews 8:5; 1 Chronicles 28:12, 19. And the sevenfold phrase \n(in Exo 40) \"as the LORD commanded Moses\" witnesses to the Divine ordering of all. It was so \nwith the twenty-four courses of priests in the earthly Temple; these were formed on the \"pattern \nof things in the heavens.\" Why is it necessary for us, when God tells us anything, to conclude \nthat it means something else? Why, when, in Revelation 4, we read of the twenty-four heavenly \nelders, are we to assume they are anything but what we read, viz., the leaders of the heavenly \nworship? Why seek to make them redeemed men, or the symbolical representation of redeemed \nmen? Why not leave them alone? It is by such additions as these to what is written that the \npeople of God are divided up into so many schools and parties. Those who regard them as representing the redeemed have done so on the supposed authority of Revelation 5:9; but they have been misled by some scribe who, in copying Revelation 5:9, \naltered certain words either to make the passage conform to Revelation 1:5, 6 (which is \nsomewhat similar), or to support this very view. Thus it has been handed down that these twenty-\nfour elders were redeemed, and are therefore glorified human beings. But it is now known that the ancient and true reading was very different. That reading is given in the Revised Version thus:\u0160\"And they sing a new song, saying, Worthy art Thou to take the \nbook, and to open the seals thereof; for Thou wast slain and dist purchase unto God men* of \nevery tribe, and tongue, and people, and nation, and madest them** to be unto our God a \nkingdom^ and priests: and they reign^^ upon the earth.\" * The word hmaV (heemas), \"us,\" goes out, with the authority of Lachmann, \nTischendorf, Alford, Westcott and Hort, the Revisers, and the Codex A. It is true that \nthe authorities are divided as to this word, but as they are unanimous as to the other \nchanges in the verse, this word necessarily must go out as the result.** The word hmaV (heemas), \"us,\" must be changed for autouV (autous), \"them,\" with all the critical authorities. ^ The word basileiV (basileis), \"kings,\" must be changed for basileian (basileian), \"a kingdom,\" with all the critical authorities. ^^ The word basileusomen (basileusomen), \"we shall reign,\" must be changed for basileuousin (basileuousin), \"they reign,\" with Lachmann, Tregelles, Alford, \nWestcott and Hort, the Revisers, and Codexes A and B. Or, for basileusousin (basileusousin), \"they shall reign,\" with Griesbach, Scholz, Tischendorf, Tregelles in margin, and Sinaitic Codex. Thus the ancient and true reading takes away all ground for making these elders redeemed men, and leaves them the angelic leaders of the heavenly worship.   TWENTY-FIVEbeing the square of five (52 or 5x5), expresses the essence of the signification of five, i.e. grace, whether used alone or occurring as a factor in larger numbers. The same may be said of \n  TWENTY-SEVENbeing the cube of three. \n  TWENTY-EIGHTis a multiple, and therefore has the significance of seven. Being also the product of 4 x 7 it partakes of the significance of 4. See pp. 194, 195.   TWENTY-NINEis the combination of 20, the number of expectation, and 9, the number of judgment.   THIRTYbeing 3 x 10, denotes in a higher degree the perfection of Divine order, as marking the right moment. CHRIST was thirty years of age at the commencement of His ministry, Luke 3:23. JOSEPH, His type, was the same age, Genesis 41:46. DAVID also, when he began to reign, 2 Samuel 5:4.   \n  THIRTY-ONEThe Hebrew expression of this is l), El, the name of God, and its signification as a number or factor would be Deity.     FORTYhas long been universally recognized as an important number, both on account of the frequency of its occurrence, and the uniformity of its association with a period of probation, trial, and \nchastisement\u0160(not judgment, like the number 9, which stands in connection with the \npunishment of enemies, but the chastisement of sons, and of a covenant people). It is the product \nof 5 and 8, and points to the action of grace (5), leading to and ending in revival and renewal \n(8). This is certainly the case where forty relates to a period of evident probation. But where it \nrelates to enlarged dominion, or to renewed or extended rule, then it does so in virtue of its \nfactors 4 and 10, and in harmony with their signification. There are 15 such periods which appear on the surface of the Scriptures, and which may be thus classified:\u0160 l     Forty Years of Probation by Trial: \nIsrael in the wilderness, Deut 8:2-5; Psa 95:10; Acts 13:18 (the third 40 of Moses' life, \n120 years). \nIsrael from the crucifixion to the destruction of Jerusalem. l     Forty Years of Probation by Prosperity in Deliverance and Rest: \nunder Othniel, Judg 3:11, \nunder Barak, Judg 5:31, \nunder Gideon, Judg 8:28. l     Forty Years of Probation by Prosperity in Enlarged Dominion: \nunder David, 2 Sam 5:4, \nunder Solomon, 1 Kings 11:42, under Jeroboam II. See 2 Kings 12:17,18, 13:3,5,7,22,25, 14:12-14,23,28, under Jehoash, 2 Kings 12:1, \nunder Joash, 2 Chron 24:1. l     Forty Years of Probation by Humiliation and Servitude: \nIsrael under the Philistines, Judg 13:1. \nIsrael in the time of Eli, 1 Sam 4:18. \nIsrael under Saul, Acts 13:21. l     Forty Years of Probation by Waiting: \nMoses in Egypt, Acts 7:23. \nMoses in Midian, Acts 7:30   FORTY DAYSThere are eight of such great periods on the surface of the Bible: l     Forty days Moses was in the mount, Exo 24:18; and to receive the Law, Exo 24:18. l     Forty days Moses was in the mount after the sin of the Golden Calf, Deut 9:18,25. l     Forty days of the spies, issuing in the penal sentence of the 40 years, Num 13:26, 14:34. l     Forty days of Elijah in Horeb, 1 Kings 19:8. l     Forty days of Jonah and Nineveh, Jonah 3:4. l     Forty days Ezekiel lay on his right side to symbolize the 40 years of Judah's \ntransgression.* l     Forty days Jesus was tempted of the Devil, Matt 4:2. l     Forty days Jesus was seen of His disciples, speaking of the things pertaining to the \nkingdom of God, Acts 1:2. * Thus 40 becomes a number closely connected with Judah, as 390 (Eze 4:5) is the \nnumber of separated Israel. The significance of this will be seen (on p. 215), for 40 is a multiple of 8, and 390 is a multiple of 13. It may also be noted that 65 (5x13) is the number of Ephraim, while 70 is specially connected with Jerusalem.   FORTY-TWOis a number connected with Antichrist. An important part of his career is to last for 42 months (Rev 11:2, 13:5), and thus this number is fixed upon him. Another number of Antichrist is 1260, \nand this is 30 x 42. Its factors are six and seven (6x7=42), and this shows a connection between man and the Spirit of God, and between Christ and Antichrist: l     Forty-two stages of Israel's wanderings mark their conflict with the will of God. l     Forty-two young men* mocked the ascension of Elijah to Elisha, 2 Kings 2:23, 24. * See note on p. 203.  Being a multiple of seven, it might be supposed that it would be connected with spiritual perfection. But it is the product of six times seven. Six, therefore, being the number of Man, and \nman's opposition to God, forty-two becomes significant of the working out of man's opposition \nto God. There may be something more in the common phrase about things being all \"sixes and sevens.\" They are so, indeed, when man is mixed up with the things of God, and when religious \"flesh\" \nengages in spiritual things. See under \"Six and Seven,\" pp. 158-167.   IN GEMATRIAit is a factor in the number of Nimrod's name, which is 294, or 42 x 7. It will be often found as a \nfactor in the Antichristian names. See under the number Thirteen. It does not often appear as a separate number, but when it is thus seen as a factor of another number, it always imparts its significance to it.     FIFTYis the number of jubilee or deliverance. It is the issue of 7 x 7 (72), and points to deliverance and rest following on as the result of the perfect consummation of time.     FIFTY-ONEThis is the number of Divine revelation, for there are 24 books in the Old Testament, and 27 books in the New Testament, \nmaking 51 in all. This is, of course, reckoning the Divine separation of the books, as exhibited in the MSS, which \nform our only authority, and not reckoning according to man's manipulation of them; for both \nJewish and Gentile fancies and reasonings make quite a different and conflicting number. See pp. 25, 26.     SIXTY-FIVEbeing a multiple of thirteen (13x5=65), is specially associated with Ephraim (see Isa 7:8), and marks the apostasy of that Tribe. This apostasy, which began in Judg 17, afterwards extended to \nthe Ten-Tribe kingdom, which is frequently spoken of therefore under the name of \"Ephraim.\" \"Within three-score and five years shall Ephraim be broken that it be not a people.\"     SEVENTYis another combination of two of the perfect numbers, seven and ten. We have seen something of the significance of their sum under the number seventeen; their product is no less significant. As compared with the sum of two numbers, the product exhibits the significance of each in an intensified form. Hence 7 x 10 signifies perfect spiritual order carried out with all spiritual power and significance. Both spirit and order are greatly emphasised.   THE SEVENTY NATIONSwhich peopled the earth are set forth with a particularity which shows the importance of the fact (see Gen 10).   THE SEVENTY SOULS OF GENESIS 46are marked not only by the perfection of spiritual truth, as seen by the multiple of 7, but by the perfection of Divine order, as seen in the multiple of 10, seventy being 7 x 10. We stop not to notice the number given in Acts 7:14, which is different because it refers to a different classification, viz., \"all his kindred,\" which amounted to 75. In Genesis 46:26, God is speaking of another class, viz., only those \"which came out of his loins\"; these were seventy in \nnumber. This number is made up in a remarkable manner, distinguishing the descendants of Leah and her maid from Rachel and her maid,* the latter being a more marked multiple of 7:\u0160 * The gematria of their names is just as remarkable. See pp. 210, 211. The Children of Leah 33   (3x11)(Only 32 are named, because one, viz., Jochebed,* the mother of Moses, \nthough conceived, was not born till Egypt was reached (Num 26:59), and \ntherefore could not be named here.)   The children of her maid Zilpah 16   (4x4)Together (though not separately) making a multiple of 7   49 (7x7)The children of Rachel 14   (2x7)The children of her maid Bilhah 7    21 (3x7)Making separately and together a multiple of seven   70 (7x10)* The gematria of her name is 42 (6x7), for though of Divine calling she was very human. These seventy built up the nation of Israel. See Genesis 46:27; Exodus 1:5 and Ruth 4:11. Seventy elders furnished Israel's great Tribunal, Exodus 24:1; Numbers 11:16, afterwards called the Sanhedrim. See below, under the next number (120). Seventy disciples sent out by the Lord prefigure the mighty host which followed them (Luke 10:1,17) in spirit and in power. It is the number specially connected with   JERUSALEMfor the city kept its sabbaths seventy years, while Judah was in Babylon, Jeremiah 35:11. And seventy sevens were determined upon it to complete its transgression, and bring in everlasting righteousness for it, Daniel 9:24 (see pp. 5, 6, 7,).     ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTYis made up of three forties (3x40=120). Applied to time therefore it signifies a divinely appointed period of probation, Genesis 6:3. Applied to persons it points to a divinely appointed number during a period of waiting, Acts 1:15. It is a factor also in the number of those who returned from Babylon, 42,360, being 120 x 353. It is also a factor of the number of the men who went up out of Egypt, 600,000, being 120 x 5000. It is a factor also of the 144,000 who will be sealed from the Twelve Tribes of Israel to go unscathed through the great tribulation, 144,000, being 120 x 1200. The unanimous voice of Jewish tradition agrees with the Talmud* that \"the Great Synagogue\" (Neh 10:1-10) consisted of 120 members. \"It was called 'Great\" because of the \ngreat work it effected in restoring the Divine law to its former greatness, and because of the \ngreat authority and reputation which it enjoyed.\" Its greatest work was in completing the Canon \nof the Old Testament. The Great Synagogue lasted about 110 years, from BC 410-300, or from \nthe latter days of Nehemiah to the death of Simon the Just. It then passed into the Sanhedrim, \nwhen its whole constitution was changed. * Jerusalem Berachoth, ii. 4; Jerusalem Megilla, i; Bab. Meg. 176. ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY AND THREEThis is a number which has taxed the ingenuity of some of the greatest of Bible students, and \nthat from the earliest times. All have felt there must be something deeply significant and \nmysterious in this number, from the solemn way in which it is introduced in John \n21:11,\u0160\"Simon Peter went up and drew the net to land full of great fishes, one hundred and \nfifty and three.\" Other miracles are parables in their lessons, and Augustine* has pointed out the comparison and contrast between the two miraculous draughts of fishes, one at the beginning and the other \nat the end of Christ's ministry (after His resurrection). He and other Commentators see in this \nnumber some connection with the saved, as being definite and particular down even to the last \none, making up not a large round number, but a smaller and odd number, 153. They saw in this \na proof of the fact that the number of the elect is fixed and pre-ordained.** * Tractates on the Gospel according to St. John, 122.** So Trench, Notes on the Miracles, p. 194. Jerome also sees there is some deeper meaning in the number, and says that there are 153 sorts of fish, i.e., all kinds of men enclosed in the Gospel net. Other more surprising suggestions have been made, but they are all the outcome of fancy. The utmost that can be said is that had it been the round number 150, there would have been an absence of all definiteness, but as it goes beyond and gives the three by which the 150 is \nexceeded, it does seem to convey the impression that we have here, if these fishes are a symbol \nof the saved, an illustration and confirmation of our Lord's words, recorded in the same Gospel, \n\"of all that He [the Father] hath given Me I should lose nothing\" (John 6:39), and \"those that \nThou gavest Me I have kept, and none of them is lost\" (John 17:12). When we come to the way in which the significance of this number has been estimated, we find a variety of modes. Augustine and Gregory the Great both start with the fact that 17 is the sum of \n10 and 7. For the significance of the number 17 (see p. 258). But they deal with the 17 in different ways. Gregory simply multiplies 17 by 3 and again by 3 (i.e., 17x32), and thus arrives at 153. Augustine, on the other hand, employs addition, and takes the sum of all the digits to and including 17 as amounting to exactly 153. He says,* \"For if you add 2 to 1, you have 3, of \ncourse; if to these you add 3 and 4, the whole number makes 10; and then if you add all the \nnumbers that follow up to 17, the whole amounts to the aforesaid number [153]; that is, if to 10, \nwhich you had reached by adding all together from 1 to 4, you add 5, you have 15; to these add \n6, and the result is 21; then add 7, and you have 28; to this add 8, and 9, and 10, and you get \n55; to this add 11, and 12, and 13, and you have 91; and to this again add 14, and 15, and 16, \nand it comes to 136; and then add to this the remaining number of which we have been \nspeaking, namely 17, and it will make up the number of fishes.\"** * Tractate on John, 122.** We should express this, now, more scientifically, and say, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 + 13 +14 + 15 + 16 + 17 = 153. And Gregory's we should express thus: (10 + 7) x (3 x 3) = 153. Bishop Wordsworth arrives at his result in a different manner. He uses two numbers, and employs both multiplication and addition. First he takes the square of 12 (which he holds to be \nthe Church number), and then he adds the square of 3 (the number of the Godhead), and points out that 122 + 32 = 153, or (12 x 12) + (3 x 3). We might give yet another contribution to these various modes as the result of our investigations in numbers, and say that 153 = 9 x 17, and see in this number all judgment (9) exhausted for the \npeople of God (17) in the person of their Surety. All, however, agree in the great and blessed fact that \"Salvation is of the Lord,\" Divine alike in its source, its agency, and its results. The same Divine character is stamped upon this miracle and its lessons by the number of disciples who were present when it was wrought. There were seven. And the seven is divided \ninto 3 and 4 as usual\u01603 being named, and 4 unnamed. The one lesson that remains is true, namely, that the whole number of the redeemed are saved by the power of the Triune God. We may condense all this by calling 153 simply, \n  THE NUMBER OF THE SONS OF GOD!The expression Myhl)h ynb (Beni Ha-Elohim), \"Sons of God,\" occurs seven times!* * One of them is slightly different, yh-l) ynb (Beni El-hai), \"sons of the living God.\" Thus the human and divine element is seen in the six and seven (see p. 164). Now the gematria of this expression is exactly 153. Thus: b = 2n = 50y = 10h = 5) = 1l = 30h = 5y = 10M = 40  153In Greek, the expression exhibits in another form the same phenomena, the gematria being \n3213, or 3 x 7 x 153. It is very remarkable, in connection with this, that in Job 2:1 we have \"Beni-ha Elohim with Satan among them.\" The gematria of this phrase is 1989, and the two factors of this number are \n153 and 13 (13x153=1989). The word sunklhronomoi (sunkleeronomoi), \"joint-heirs\" (Rom 8:17), amounts to 1071, the factors of which are 153 and 7 (153x7=1071). The expression suklhronomoi de Cristou (sunkleeronomoi de Christou), \"joint heirs with Christ\" (Rom 8:17), amounts to 2751. Now the factors of 153, as we have seen, are 9 and 17, \nand the number 2751 is three times the nine hundred, plus seventeen, viz., 3 x (900 + 17) = \n2751. The expression ktisiV qeou (ktisis Theou), \"the creation of God,\" is 1224, or 8 x 153. In the record of the miracle itself there are some remarkable phenomena:\u0160 The word for \"fishes\" icqueV (ichthues), is by gematria 1224, or 8 x 153.The words for \"the net\" are to diktuon, and by gematria this also amounts to 1224, or 8 x 153, for it is unbroken, and carries the precious freight from \"the \nright side\" of the ship safely to the shore, and \"not one is lost.\" Quite a new thought has recently been given by Lieut.-Col. F. Roberts, who finds that amongst \nthe multitudes who received direct blessing from Christ there are recorded exactly 153 special \nindividual cases! We append his list, with one or two alterations: and if any names appear to be \nmissing, it will be found on examination that there is good reason for omitting them; e.g., \nNathanael is the same as Bartholomew; while Matthias, and Barsabas (Acts 1:23), Joses, \nBarnabas (Acts 4:36), Stephen, though they with many others may have received blessing from \nJesus Himself, and probably did, yet it is not so stated. Of course Zacharias, Elisabeth, John the \nBaptist, Joseph, Simeon, and Anna, are not included, as they were all in blessing before the \nbirth of Jesus. The following is the list:\u0160 1.  The leper, Matt 8:2 (1) 2.  Centurion and servant, Matt 8:5 (2) \n3.  Peter's wife's mother, Matt 8:14 (1) \n4.  Two possessed with devils, Matt 8:18 (2) \n5.  Palsied man and bearers [Mark 2:3], Matt 9:2 (5) \n6.  Jairus and his daughter, Matt 9:18 (2) \n7.  Woman with issue of blood, Matt 9:21 (1) \n8.  Blind men, Matt 9:27 (2) \n9.  Dumb man, Matt 9:32 (1) 10.  Eleven Apostles, Matt 10:2 (11) \n11.  Man with withered hand, Matt 12:10 (1) \n12.  Blind and dumb devil, Matt 12:22 (1) \n13.  Brethren of the Lord [Acts 1:14] Matt 13:55 (4) \n14.  Syrophoenician woman and daughter, Matt 15:22 (2) \n15.  Lunatic child and father, Matt 17:14 (2) \n16.  Blind men (leaving Jericho),* Matt 20:30 (2) \n17.  Simon the leper, Matt 26:6 (1) \n18.  Mary (sister of Lazarus. See Nos 32 and 47), Matt 26:7 (1) \n19.  Centurion; Matt 27:54 (1) 20.  Salome (mother of Zebedee's children), Matt 27:56 (1) 21.  Mary (mother of James, and wife of Cleopas), Matt 27:56 (1) \n22.  Mary Magdalene, Matt 27:56 (1) \n23.  Joseph of Arimathaea, Matt 27:57 (1) \n24.  Man with unclean spirit; Mark 1:23 (1) \n25.  Man, deaf and dumb, Mark 7:32 (1) \n26.  Blind man, Mark 8:22 (1) \n27.  Son of the widow of Nain, Luke 7:12 (1) \n28.  A woman, a sinner, Luke 7:37 (1) \n29.  Joanna and Susanna, Luke 8:3 (2) \n30.  A disciple\u0160\"follow Me\", Luke 9:59 (1) \n31.  The seventy disciples, Luke 10:1 (70) \n32.  Martha, Luke 10:38 (1) \n33.  Woman with infirmity, Luke 13:11 (1) \n34.  Man with dropsy, Luke 14:2 (1) \n35.  The ten lepers, Luke 17:12 (10) \n36.  The blind man (approaching Jericho),** Luke 18:35 (1) \n37.  Zaccheus, Luke 19:2 (1) \n38.  Malchus [John 18:10], Luke 22:51 (1) \n39.  Penitent thief, Luke 23:43 (1) \n40.  The two disciples at Emmaus, Luke 24:13 (2) \n41.  Nicodemus, John 3:1 (1) \n42.  Woman of Samaria, John 4:4 (1) \n43.  Nobleman and sick son, John 4:46 (2) \n44.  Impotent man (Bethesda), John 5:1 (1) \n45.  Woman taken in adultery, John 8:11 (1) \n46.  Man born blind, John 9 (1) \n47.  Lazarus, John 11 (1) \n48.  Mary, mother of Jesus, John 19:25 (1) = (153) * Bartimeus being one of them (Mark 10:46), these two being healed as Jesus left \nJericho. ** The blind man (No. 36) was healed (Luke 18:35) \"as He was come nigh unto Jericho,\" and therefore is additional to the two who were healed as He was leaving Jericho (No. 16). See Matt 20:30; Mark 10:46. We give the above not as an alternative solution, but as an additional illustration, believing that all may be true; and at any rate, that all contribute to, and increase the cumulative evidence in \nsupport of the same great and blessed fact, that it is true of the Lord's people as it is of the stars, \n\"He calleth them all by their names\" (Psa 147:4). The book of Exodus is the book in which we \nfirst hear of redemption (Exo 15:14), and the Hebrew and divinely canonical name for this book \nis \"THE NAMES,\" because His people are redeemed by name! This is the lesson of the 153 great fishes.   TWO HUNDREDTwenty is the number of expectancy as we have seen (p. 262). Here we have it tenfold (20x10). The significance of this number is suggested by John 6:7, where we read, \"Two hundred pennyworth of bread is NOT SUFFICIENT for them.\" And so we find this number stamping various things with insufficiency. l     Achan's 200 shekels were \"not sufficient\" to save him from the consequences of his sin (Josh 7:21). This shows us the insufficiency of money (Psa 49:7-9). l     Absalom's 200 shekels weight of hair were \"not sufficient\" to save him, but rather \ncaused his destruction (2 Sam 14:26, 18:9). This shows us the insufficiency of beauty. l     Micah's graven image was purchased for 200 shekels (Judg 17:4 and 18), and led to the \nintroduction of idolatry into Israel and the blotting out of the Tribes of Dan and \nEphraim from the blessing of Revelation 7, showing us the insufficiency of mere \nreligion. l     Ezra's 200 \"singing men and women\" (Ezra 2:65), were \"not sufficient\" to produce \n\"peace with God,\" true spiritual worship, or joy in the Lord. Only God's word rightly \nministered can lead to this (Neh 8:5-9). This shows the insufficiency of external things \nin the worship of God, and the impossibility of worshipping God with the senses. True \nworship, which alone God will accept, \"MUST\" (John 4:24) be spiritual.     THREE HUNDRED AND NINETYThis is the number of Israel (Eze 4:5), being 13 x 30; as 65 (5x13) is the number of Ephraim (Isa 7:8); as 40 (5x8) is the number of Judah (Eze 4:6); and 70 (7x10) is the number of Jerusalem. \nSee further under these numbers respectively, and under 8 and 13 also. As a matter of chronology it was 390 years from the division of the Tribes to the Captivity, and thus the duration of the separate kingdom of Israel was 390 years, as referred to in Ezekiel 4. \nSee p. 215.       FOUR HUNDREDis the product of 8 and 50, and is a divinely perfect period. \nFrom the fulfillment of the promise to Abraham in the birth of Isaac to the Exodus was a period of 400 years. Stephen mentions it as dating from \"his seed\" (Acts 7:6), and God dates it from the same point when He says to Abraham, \"thy seed\" (Gen 15:13).* * The structure of this verse rescues it from the way in which it is sadly misunderstood:\u0160A. \"Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a strange \nland that is not theirs, B. and shall serve them;B. and they shall afflict them A. four hundred years.\" The structure places B and B in a parenthesis. A and A cover the whole time of the sojourn, while B and B refer to the service and sojourn during a parenthesis of unnamed length within that time. The structure of Acts 7:6 is exactly the same. It is popularly confounded with quite a different period of     FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTYyears, which, though it has the same point as to its termination, does not commence at the same point. From the call of Abraham, or the \"promise\" made to him at that call (Gen 12:3), unto the Exodus was 430 years. This covers the whole period of the \"sojourning\"; not of Abraham's \n\"seed,\" as in Genesis 15:13 and Acts 7:6, but of Abraham himself. This is what is mentioned in \nGalatians 3:17 as the period from the \"promise\" to the \"Law.\" It is referred to also in Exodus \n12:40, where the \"sojourning\" is the nominative case (or subject) of the verb, while the \nsentence, \"who dwelt in Egypt,\" is merely a relative clause, defining parenthetically an \nimportant point concerning them.   \n  FOUR HUNDRED AND NINETYThis is the period of the 70 sevens referred to under the head of Chronology (pp. 5, 6). We need not therefore further enlarge on it here beyond pointing out the spiritual significance of the number itself as being seven times seventy. Daniel was praying, and he was concerned about the 70 years prophesied of by Jeremiah (Dan 9:2 and Jer 25:11,12, 19:10). And the answer meant that though those 70 appointed years were \nabout to end in restoration and blessing, another period of seven times 70 years had been \ndetermined (9:24-27), and they would commence from the very \"decree\" (Neh 2) which should \nend the former 70 years. And these should run their course, marked by certain incidents, before \nthe full and final restoration of Daniel's \"city\" and \"people\" should be accomplished. The number 490 marks the product of spiritual perfection (7) with regard to the working out of Jerusalem's number (70). For 7 times 70 is 490.     SIX HUNDRED AND SIXTY SIXis \"the number of a name\" (Rev 13:17,18). When the name of Antichrist is known its gematria will doubtless be found to be the number 666. But this number has, we believe, a far deeper \nreference to and connection with the secret mysteries of the ancient religions, which will be \nagain manifested in connection with the last great apostasy. Many names may be found, the numerical value of whose letters amounts to 666. We have a list of about forty such gematria. Most of them are ridiculous, inasmuch as instead of the gematria \nbeing confined to Hebrew and Greek (which have no Arabic or other special signs for figures), \nthe principle is extended to names in English, French, and other modern languages, on the \nassumption that they would have been spelt in exactly the same way; whereas we know that \nnames both of persons and places are not simply transliterated in various languages. It is \nabusrd therefore to attempt to take words from the modern European languages which use \nArabic figures. Gematria is not a means by which the name is to be discovered; but it will be a test and a proof by which the name may be identified after the person is revealed. If six is the number of secular or human perfection, then 66 is a more emphatic expression of the same fact, and 666 is the concentrated expression of it; 666 is therefore the trinity of human \nperfection; the perfection of imperfection; the culmination of human pride in independence of \nGod and opposition to His Christ. The number, however, has to be computed (yhfizw (pseephizo), to reckon, to calculate, not merely to count or enumerate). See Revelation 13:18. Therefore it is not to be known by \ngematria merely, though, as we have said, that will be one of the factors in the calculation, just \nas the letters in the word Jesus amount to 888. But 666 was the secret symbol of the ancient pagan mysteries connected with the worship of the Devil. It is to day the secret connecting link between those ancient mysteries and their modern revival in Spiritualism, Theosophy, etc. The efforts of the great enemy are now directed towards uniting all into one great whole. The newspapers, wordldy and religious, are full of schemes as to such a union. \"Reunion\" is in the air. The societies for the re-union of Christendom, and the \nConferences for the re-union of the Churches, are alike parts of the same great movement, and \nare all making for and are signs of the coming Apostasy. During this age, \"Separation\" is God's \nword for His people, and is the mark of Christ; while \"union\" and \"re-union\" is the mark of \nAntichrist. The number 6 was stamped on the old mysteries. The great secret symbol consisted of the three letters SSS, because the letter S in the Greek alphabet was the symbol of the figure 6 (see page 49). a = 1, b = 2, g = 3, d = 4, e = 5, but when it came to 6, another letter was introduced! Not the next\u0160the sixth letter (z, zeta)\u0160but a different letter, a peculiar form of S, called \"stigma\" (V). Now the word stigma (stigma), means a mark, but especially a mark made by a brand as burnt upon slaves, cattle, or soldiers, by their owners or masters; or on devotees who thus branded themselves as belonging to their gods. It is from stizw, stizo, to prick, or brand with a hot iron. Hence it came to be used of scars or wound-prints, and it is thus used by Paul of \nhis scars, which he regarded as the tokens of his sufferings, the marks which he bore on his \nbody for the sake of his Lord and Master, and marking him as belonging to the one who had \nbought him (Gal 6:17). This letter is becoming familiar to us now; and it is not pleasant when we see many thus marked (ignorantly, no doubt) with the symbolical \"S,\" \"S,\" especially when it is connected, not with \n\"salvation,\" but with judgment, and is asociated with \"blood and fire,\" which, in Joel 2:30, 31, \nis given as one of the awful signs \"before the great and terrible day of the Lord come.\" Apostasy is before us. The religion of Christ has, in the past, been opposed and corrupted, but when it once comes, as it has come in our day, to be burlesqued, there is nothing left but \njudgment. There is nothing more the enemy can do before he proceeds to build up the great \napostasy on the ruins of true religion, and thus prepare the way for the coming of the Judge. It is remarkable that the Romans did not use all the letters of their alphabet, as did the Hebrews and Greeks. They used only six letters,* D, C, L, X, V, and I. And it is still more remarkable, and \nperhaps significant, that the sum of these amounts to 666:\u0160 * The M appears to have been merely two D's. 1. D \n= 500 600 6662. C \n= 1003. L \n= 50 604. X \n= 105. V \n= 5 66. I = 1In each of the three pairs there is an addition of one, for 6 = 5 + 1. It is the grace of God superseded by the corruption of man. It will be seen from this that the number 666 is very far-reaching, and is filled with a meaning deeper, perhaps, than anything we have yet discovered. One thing, however, is certain, and that \nis, that the triple 6 marks the culmination of man's opposition to God in the person of the \ncoming Antichrist. Further illustration of the significance of this number is seen in the fact that   THE DURATION OF THE OLD ASSYRIAN EMPIREwas 666 years before it was conquered by Babylon. \n  JERUSALEM WAS TRODDEN DOWNby the Roman Empire exactly 666 years from the battle of Actium, BC 31, to the Saracen conquest in AD 636.* * See The Witness of the Stars, by the same author.   THERE ARE THREE MENwhich stand out in Scripture as the avowed enemies of God and of His people. Each is branded \nwith this number six that we may not miss their significance: 1. GOLIATH, whose height was 6 cubits, and he had 6 pieces of armour;* his \nspear's head weighed 600 shekels of iron (1 Sam 17:4-7).2. NEBUCHADNEZZAR, whose \"image\" which he set up,** was 60 cubits high and 6 cubits broad (Dan 3:1), and which was worshipped when the music was \nheard from 6 specified instruments,*** and 3. ANTICHRIST, whose number is 666. * In Ephesians 6:14-18, the Christian's armour has a seventh piece\u0160\"Prayer.\" See under \"Seven.\" ** We must distinguish the \"image\" which he set up, from the \"man\" of whom he afterwards dreamt. The proportions are not the same. \nThe height of a man is to his breadth not as 10:1. Some have \ntherefore thought that this \"image\" may have been an obelisk. But \nas the word for \"image\" denotes a form or likeness, it may have \nbeen like the form of a man standing on a pedestal of which the \nheight was included. The pedestal being probably 24 (6x4) cubits, \nand the image 36 (6x6). *** The numerical value (by gematria) of the words in Daniel 3:1, which describe the setting up of this image is 4662. The very figures \nare significant, but still more so are the factors of this number. 4662 = 7 x 666. In the first we have one six connected with the pride of fleshly might. In the second we have two sixes connected with the pride of absolute dominion. In the third we have three sixes connected with the pride of Satanic guidance. \n  THE TALENTS OF GOLDbrought to Solomon in a year were 666 (1 Kings 10:14). But this perfection of money-power was only \"vanity and vexation of spirit\" (Eccl 2:8,11; compare 1 Tim 6:10). As to the triple number 666, we have already seen (page 121) that while one figure (6) is significant, two figures (66) are still more so; and three figures (666) seem to denote the concentration or essence of the particular number. We see further examples of this in Jesus, 888, the dominical number; Sodom, 999, the number of judgment; \nDamascus, 444, the world number; \nThe beast, 666, the number of man. \n\"Verily, verily, I say unto you,\" 888; \nThe Lord God made, 888; etc., etc. \"The children of Adonikam\" who returned from the Captivity (Ezra 2:13) numbered 666. \nAdonikam means the lord of the enemy. This is suggestive, even though it may be vague. The number 666 has another remarkable property. It is further marked as the concentration and essence of 6 by being the sum of all the numbers which makes up the square of six! The square of six is 36 (62, or 6x6), and the sum of the numbers 1 to 36 = 666, i.e., 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 + 13 + 14 + 15 + 16 + 17 + 18 + 19 + 20 + 21 + 22 + 23 + 24 + 25 + 26 + 27 + 28 + 29 + 30 + 31 + 32 + 33 + 34 + 35 + 36 = 666. They may be arranged in the form of a square with six figures each way, so that the sum of each six figures in any direction shall be another significant trinity = 111. 6 32 3 34 35 17 11 27 28 8 3019 14 16 15 23 2418 20 22 21 17 1325 29 10 9 26 1236 5 33 4 2 31  GEMATRIAIt is remarkable that the numerical value of the \"SONG OF MOSES\" (Exo 15:1-18) is 41626, \nwhich is the product of the significant factors 13 x 42 x 70. On the other hand, if we compare \"the Song of Moses and of the Lamb,\" in Revelation 15:1-5, the remarkable value is 9261, which has the remarkable factors 33 x 73.     CONCLUSIONWe have now come to the end of our survey of number as used by God in His works and in His Word, and we have seen that all is perfect. Our apprehension and interpretation of the phenomena may be marked with many imperfections, and we are conscious that after all we have but touched the fringe of this great \nand important subject. One thing, however, is certain, and that is, that we have, in the Scripture of Truth, a revelation from God absolutely without error, and whatever difficulties we may encounter in seeking to \nunderstand it, they are all the outcome of our own infirmities. Of another thing we are also certain, that the Written Word cannot be separated from the Living Word, nor the spiritual meaning of the one understood without a living union with the other. It may be said of the Word of God, as it is written of the New Jerusalem (Rev 21:23), \"THE LAMB IS THE LIGHT THEREOF.\"   Back | Contents | Next "
