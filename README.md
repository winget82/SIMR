# SIMR
Scripture Indices and Ministry Resources
This is a personal project for study of the bible.  Currently I am learning to code, so this is a project to help me in that process and also benefit from.
It is currently command line based, but I plan to make a GUI (started) and also a webpage (started).
I have made json files from readily available public domain resources (but may redo them as I learn more effective ways).
Currently this is a python program, run from the command line, that will let you do some research and produces a text file of that research.  Such as verses, notes, Greek/Hebrew definitions.  You can pass a verse or a list of verses in and it will give you all the Greek/Hebrew for that verse as well as their definitions, etc.
